We were in a refurbished basic cottage.  I\\'m sure there would have been cobwebs had we looked hard enough, based on other reviews, but certainly we found the house to be hygienically clean with no issues that we noticed.On arrival we realised that a bathroom lock didn\\'t work.  We went straight to reception (no queue) to report it, and within 20 minutes a man turned up at the door with a drill and fixed it.  Very impressed!We thought the pool was great, and we saw the changing and other areas being cleaned regularly.  Although health and safety is generally more lax abroad, the lifeguards were very good at stopping young children to check they were with adults etc.  As others have said, be aware that this is a very hilly site.  I hadn\\'t appreciated the extent to which this would be an issue for us.  It meant that bike rides weren\\'t really enjoyable, and it was a pain travelling back and forth to the shop etc., where usually we\\'ve found that part of the charm of a CP holiday.My only real gripe was the number of cars on site every day of the holiday.  Each time we cycled to/from our cottage we had to give way to at least 5 cars, which to my mind defeats one of the main points of CP.  All we can think is that it was people going out for the day, and because of the hills they were collecting family members in the car to save them a walk to/from the car park. Unless disabled I personally don\\'t think this is fair on fellow holidaymakers.Overall another great CP stay.", "title": "Great holiday, but too many cars on site", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 31, 2018", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2018"},

Very easy to get to from Calais like others have said 2:5 hours and 17 euros (tolls do take credit cards).When we arrived we were greeted well, they spoke fairly good English and we tried our best to talk in French. We have only two negatives about the holiday. Firstly we were told 384 cottage not 284 not a problem as key/fob had 284 but we was not told what zone so ended up looping around a few times as we were over in the furthest point. We was going to do VIP but opted for the premier lake and the extra money put towards Half board. The cottage we had was really nice and great view, kids loved it and very comfy beds..Breakfast served between 8 and 10:30am and for value very good. Friendly French guy with orange sided glasses so welcoming but obviously didn\\'t speak English but just genuine nice, all staff were, even the omelette making woman eventually smiled as our French got better!Ate in the Italian twice and buffet once on reflection would of done other way around.Only activity was the indoor mini golf (second moan) 9 Euros each for 11 holes bit pricey but fun to do, just play several rounds.Swimming was great plenty slides.Some people have mentioned poor maintenance on site, personally we didn\\'t see it and site was immaculate.

The site is signposted from Laon.We stayed for 11 nights in a 4 person VIP Lakeside villa which was wonderful. It was well presented and had everything we needed although note there is only a hob and a microwave so like us you may want to bring your own BBQ. We found booking activities was easy through either of the booking points, they all spoke good English. The kids enjoyed all the things we booked for them.We also used the bowling alley (\\u20ac32 for 50 minutes) and the large soft play area (free).We hired bikes for 7 days of our stay which you do directly at the cycle centre (they spoke good English again), bikes were about \\u20ac120 for 2 adults and 2 kids which seemed good value.Supermarket on site is small but adequate albeit very expensive. We drove the 20 minutes to the Carrefour at Laon to do a big shop.We ate out a few times at the buffet restaurant which had a reasonable selection however this was also expensive at \\u20ac27 per adult.The real gem however is the swimming pool which was much better than any of the Center Parcs we have visited in the Uk.It is huge and has loads of slides including rapids and a lazy river. We found going late evening to be the quietest times. There are quite a lot of day visitors and so it can get really busy earlier in the day.The only real negative I would say is that the site is poorly maintained. There are lots of broken windows around the centre entrance and most of the play equipment at the parks was broken which was a real shame.Just to add, we did Disney for a day which is definitely within striking distance and took 1 3/4 hours from the site.As you would expect the majority of visitors are French, I would say only about 1 in 10 are English however English is spoken  at most places you need to speak to someone.

It is a very easy drive from Calais. We stopped off at a Carrefour on the way down to do a food shop which was just off the motorway and easy to find. This is a good idea as the restaurants and shop on site are generally a bit pricey (as in all Centre Parcs) Having said that, we went out to one restaurant, L\\'Embarcad\\u00e8re, and found the quality better than in UK Centre Parcs. The best thing about this parc was the Aqua area and the kids loved it. The activities were also good although it isn\\'t very clear that you can\\'t book all of them online before going and even if you do book online, you have to go to pick up the tickets before you can do the activities. The staff were generally helpful and spoke English although it does help to speak some French and not assume they will speak English as the majority of customers are French and to be fair you are in France! The main negative is that the site is generally not very well maintained and even the house we stayed in which was supposed to be renovated , didn\\'t feel very new or clean. Having said that, I have just seen that the site is due to be closed for renovation so this may all  change. Another negative is that the health &amp; safety is not ideal.My kids had to put their own clips on for the zip wire on the High Adventure Trail and there were no staff there to do it for them or check they had done it correctly. Luckily they are good climbers and my husband was with them but he had to help another English boy in front of him who was up their on his own and found it too hard. I would recommend an adult accompanying the child unless they are very good climbers. The lift was also out of action for several days so my dad (who is in a wheelchair) could not get around the main reception area easily) I would also recommend going out for  French meal outside the park. We went to a local restaurant called l\\'Assiette du terroir which was only abut 5 minds drive away and we had a lovely simple French meal there. We had a nice time but not an amazing time.

Lovely peaceful, great weather and excellent accomodation. We had a simple 4p comfort cottage. It was nicely renovated and had all comfort we needed.Was great: the space as such, lovely garden, and plenty of silence (we didn\\u2019t even hear the neighbourgs).Could be better: kitchen equipment (one pan was not enough, dishwasher didn\\u2019t wash that well, plates and glasses were greasy, ...) and the fact it is simply not foreseen for little babies (eg there was no linnen for the baby bed, place to change the baby was also missing so we changed het on the sofa, ...) Must say that there were a few minor issues but when we called they immediately took action. Eg a chair was broken, they immediately came by to replace it. The parc itself is really nice. Many hills though which is not always easy with a baby and a toddler. You must be equipped for it.  The lake is stunning, it\\u2019s peaceful everywhere!The activities: we had a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old with us and the activities they could do were limited. I think bigger kids had much more to do.Were great: the swimming pool of course! Foreseen for all ages, nice infrastructure. The animal parc was nice too, although careful when entering with bread as all goats will attack you :-)Could be better: the playgrounds were really outdated. Broken bits and pieces made it even dangerous from time to time. No swing to be found anywhere in the parc... our daughter enjoyed herself though, which is the most important! The swimming pool also needs a thorough renovation. Mouldy parts, tiles that have broken off.

We are in a VIP lake view cottage number 416. Firstly I would point out that there is water in front of me! The level is low as there has been a heatwave but it has not detracted in any way from the beauty of the park.There are some inland property\\u2019s that would be on river/ canal offshoots where there is no water but there\\u2019s not much that can be done!The properties are not brand new or without problems however the issues that we had were dealt with swiftly, efficiently and with a smile, when you think about the use these places get and their turnaround times things get missed.. my advice is talk to or email the centre and they deal with it. I should point out that our party have very little French in our vocabulary but we found google translate worked miracles with maintenance issues and 90% of the staff that we spoke to were trying extremely hard with English so we muddled through quite comfortably.The staff generally were great, they are happy and extremely placating, 2 of us fell off our bikes at one time or another and the first time a restaurant patched us up whilst the second crash caused a flat tyre and a very nice member of staff passing picked us up with the bike and took us to get it changed. This staff member was housekeeping, did not speak English but was absolutely fantastic with the help she gave.We looked at a few restaurants, I wasn\\u2019t impressed with the Italian one as we sat without even having a drink order taken for 20 minutes before walking out, we ended up in a nice place that was expensive but not to the point that you felt it extortionate.We did a few of the activities, a word of advice do not take a child on to the high ropes and zip wire one, it can become quite traumatic for everyone!I would suggest that a \\u201cbail out\\u201d would be a good idea for any that do not want to go for the final slide!I am glad to have tried Center Parcs this year as it is different to the usual med Villa / pool holiday we have and I was pleasantly surprised to find the fears created by the negative reviews for us at least were unfounded.There are a few niggles and there is room for improvement such as instructions on the use of the cooker and sauna but all in all a great experience enjoyed by all.", "title": "Don\\u2019t believe the hype!", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 19, 2018", "trip_type": "Traveled with family", "trip_date": " August 2018"},

Make sure you stop at the large Carrefour hypermarket at the South of Laon before you arrive, great for stocking up for your trip. Layout - Modern park laid out as a long and narrow plot with the majority of houses close to or over looking the lake. Accommodation - We stayed in a Premium Refurbished 4 person house, it was very pleasant and well stocked (exceeded expectations). It was a little unclean but fine.Staff - Despite some of the comments, we found the staff friendly and had a good enough grasp of English if needed.Activities - A good wide range of activities for our 6 and 3 year old, the slides in the Aqua Mundo don\\'t really have age limits which means younger children can go on much better rides than the UK. Go Ape, Pony Rides, Quad Bikes, Trampolines, Mini Golf - all good but booked a week or two on line before arrival. Food - We ate in the Pizza/Pasta restaurant, Creperie and Grill restaurant. All the food was fine as you\\'d expect for somewhere like this. On the expensive side of acceptable but not excessively expensive.  NEGATIVESDrinks - All drinks are excessively expensive in my view, 6.5 Euros for a entry level beer.Non Exclusive - It is clear that local French people are aloud to use the Aqua Mundo which, whilst I appreciate it is peak summer, felt dangerously over crowded at times and uncomfortable. I would expect for a resort like this only to be used for people staying there. Restaurant Variety - I appreciate it is aimed at kids but the variety of cuisine is limited and very beige.

Overall the park is lovely and very kid friendly. We came with a 4 year old and 1 year old and our oldest loved everything, the pool especially. What I wish we would have known beforehand---1. We stayed in a two bedroom comfort cottage in zone 4, the walk to the center where everything was is about 20-25min, so we ended up renting bikes with baby seats for the week to get around. If you have your own you can bring them, but it seemed they had unlimited availability for all bike options including trailers, small bikes, etc. 2. Our cottage had a baby cot and high chair, but no changing table and no kid\\'s plates or cups, etc. Luckily we had a few of our own as we had most meals in our cabin for the flexibility. 3. When we did eat out, we found that they had free food for littles under 3 years, and reduced price meals for kids age 4-10, so that was a nice perk if they can handle the wait (not very long, and the two restaurants we went into had little play corners). However, the free food is really baby food, so good for babies, but our 1.5year old only ate the compote. The crepe place offered him a free crepe though, so for those in the 1-3 age range, that was the best. (We ended up going back because of that). 4. If you want to have some meals in your cabin, definitely stock up at the Carrfour near Laon beforehand as the store on site is small and higher priced. The cabin will not have any seasonings, olive oil or anything, it\\'s simply pans and dishes. We brought extra dishwasher pods as well since we had milk bottles and you\\'re given exactly 3 pods for the week. 5. They deliver meals to your door! And delivery was free, at least for what we got. Wish we had discovered this the first day, but this was a huge bonus to be able to eat nice after the kids were in bed and they included equipment (like a wok!) and picked it up from outside your door in the morning. 6. If your kid wants to do the pony ride, as mine did, they have to have closed toed shoes. We did not, as it was the middle of summer, so missed that one...7. Go to the aqua mundo first thing in the morning at 10am if you can. It starts to get crowded by 11am, so we had a good while to enjoy before it got busy and we headed out for lunch.

Premium lodge.Nice lodge, quite large, fairly clean, well equipped. Decking could do with some maintenance.Drive from UK was a piece of cake.Pool very good, absolutely packed but it seemed to cope ok with the large numbers.Mini golf, quads and farm all good.Too many cars and golf buggies on site. This really unnerved us and especially our young son when out walking and cycling. I am not sure why they allow so many cars and have so many buggies on site. This defeats the objective of the parc and is quite a negative.Middle of heat wave but fans in restaurants were all off, apparently broken!Boats not operating as low water level. Fair enough.Sports hall quite dated.Restaurant staff friendly but got everything wrong and seemed to not know what was happening most of the time. Took ages to get served, even when the numbers were low. I think the parc could be really good if they improved some areas. We like CP and think the parc should look at how the Belgian parcs are run.

Half of the reviews are terrible and others seem to have had a good time. Luckily we found it ok. There were a few niggles, like the cost of eating out and the quality of the food when you did. Thankfully, it was possible to cook in our cottage. We hired bikes for our stay and found them to be really tired and some of them were unsafe (my son cut his leg on a bit of his bike that was broken- it was exchanged). Our cottage was fine; comfortable and clean (ish). I was a bit disappointed to see dog poo in the small garden at the back: As well as cleaning the inside the maintenance teams should check the back if they are to allow dogs. I thought the shop and restaurants pricey but I expected that of Center Parcs. Don\\'t do what I did and forget your swimming gear as you\\'ll be forking out way over the odds for a new costume (ouch!).My kids loved the water park and would have spent all of their time there which was great. We also enjoyed getting around by bike. Once people were checked in and cars were parked in the car park it felt much safer and easier to navigate. I was impressed with the response time from the maintenance team when I had a problem with our fridge - they turned up about 15 minutes after I emailed and they couldn\\'t have been more helpful or kind.

The on-site supermarket was expensive but the supermarket in Laon was huge and worth a visit to stock up.We stayed in a comfort cottage. It was super clean and tidy with comfortable beds. The outside area was a bit scruffy but I think this is par for the course in centre parcs. We hired bikes for the week which is part of the Center Parcs experience and our kids love it! The (free) soft play was amazing and again our kids spent a lot of time there!Our 3 also enjoyed the free kids entertainment every night - even though it was in French!Our only criticism was that is was very very hot the week we visited and we desperately needed a fan in the cottage.Thank you Centre Parcs for a lovely holiday making lovely memories.

Standard basically good but outside decking was very wobbly and broken in some places. Oddly a hob but no oven and grill was supposed to be with microwave but we could not make it work. We tried to use whirlpool bath. OMG that was a mistake as it chucked out black mould and a small akin to Satan\\'s armpit!

When we were there it was hot, up to 37c this made doing much hard but the stuff we did was great but pool got v busy. Had a restaurant BBQ one night. Good Food and good value.

We have been to other Center Parcs is France as well as the UK. We went in May half term. French children are at school so not too busy for the week.ArrivalWe arrived well before check in due to the ferry timings from the UK. This didn\\u2019t cause any problems, staff friendly, provided our pack and keys, which allowed us to park up and use the pool (aqua mundo). We knew we couldn\\u2019t go to lodge before 3pm.Pre booked activities Once parked up and before going to the pool, we collected our tickets for the pre booked activities and booked / paid for the others that couldn\\u2019t be pre booked online. We did not have to queue like other reviews mention. I think it could however be made clearer that despite booking online, you are still required to collect tickets for activities.Aqua MundoThis is the best pool we have been to at a Center Parcs. Large indoor and outdoor areas, clean and well maintained. More slides than the other Parcs we have stayed at.The lodgeWe opted for a vip two bedroom which was on the lake and island, newly decorated. This came with sauna and whirlpool bath. The building was clean, modern. Only one thing I would say that the bedroom wall mounted lamp shade was hanging off and could not be easily fixed. The outside decking looked onto lake with table, chairs and two loungers. We did get a few mosquito bites over our week but not overrun by them. The park is well spaced out and by foot from our location would take 15 to 20 minutes to get to the main complex. We enjoyed the exercise. The only other thing I would mention about the lodges is lack of bike parking at the front. We had to rest our bike on each other against a log fence. The supermarket I have read reviews indicating limited stock. I would disagree. We found the shop had a really good selection of fresh and frozen foods etc. Yes the prices are at a premium which you come to live with. Doesn\\u2019t help with the strength of the euro against sterling.The on-site restaurantsAt best, they were average with a low level of service due to limited staff. The staff however were all friendly. My views on the restaurants apply to all Center Parcs we have stayed at. You do have the option to collect your car and take a short drive to a local restaurant or use the supermarket just down the road.SpaMy wife and I used the spa. This consisted of a sauna, steam room and hot tub. Suggest save your money and not bother, especially if you have vip lodge like we did. Compared to Nottingham Center Parcs, this spa is a poor. CyclingWe took our own bikes. Onsite people can hire golf buggies which are generally not a problem until you get close to the main complex. Minor hills onsite and being well spread out is great for biking. Also, roads offsite of quite with plenty of cycle tracks as you leave the Center Parcs site. Summary We really enjoyed our week stay. Would go back. Food onsite is expensive. Accommodation is great. We had great weather which helped. Plenty of parking onsite. The site has plenty to do for all children including a electronic football shootout wall, skate park and dj mixing station which are included in the price of the stay. You also get credits to use against certain other activities when booking your holiday. We used ours on bowling. Great fun but a little difficult adding names to computer.

Although you can buy a family ticket for 3 activities which makes it a bit more reasonable. It\\u2019s worth noting as the French schools are back when we have our school May half term the Park is quiet but it also seems to be a bit short on staff meaning sometimes you have to wait longer to be served food and drinks or for your activities to start. However this did not spoil our trips and was not too bad. The best thing about it being quiet is the swimming pool never feels busy and we didn\\u2019t have to que to go on any of the slides. All of the slides are brilliant and my boys aged 10 and 6 went in all of them. The rapids was really the only one my 6 yr old needed a bit of help.

This year however unlike previously we feel that the site seemed unprepared for a large influx of visitors from the UK.

I think they meant redecorated rather than refurbished. Upstairs there was a double and twin bedroom overlooking the lake; a twin room and bathroom at the back. Bedrooms were adequate size. Downstairs was a shower room and separate toilet. A reasonable size living/dining room with windows and French-style doors that overlooked the lake gave us superb views, as did the veranda, which was a good size and stretched to the edge of the water. The kitchen was tiny - only room for one person at a time; the sink leaked and water dripped through to the cupboard below and across the floor. Skirting boards in the kitchen looked like they had suffered damp and certainly weren\\'t changed recently. There was very little space to prepare meals for 6 and we had to remove some of the kitchen equipment like the toaster. There was a ceramic hob, which worked well, and a microwave (that we didn\\'t use) - no oven which limited what meals we could cook. Our main problem with the cottage was that it needed a good clean - it was adequate, but insects everywhere (probably because of the lake) and cobwebs around. We paid for a towel package as these are not provided...this was expensive and we could have bought a cheap pack of towels and thrown them away. No teas/coffees were provided either. I\\'ve given a positive review mainly due to the stunning views over the lake. While we were there, it was decided to shut the sports hall for 3 days without any warning - we were not pleased! The pools were warm and reasonably clean...there\\'s an infinity outdoor pool, jaccuzzis, slides, rapids (that weren\\'t), and a lazy river. Plenty of places to sit and relax around the pool.

So much to say, so I\\'ve narrowed it down to a few points to make the review more bearable!Pros:-Attractive, well-maintained site with lots of trees and green spaces.-Great pool with rapids, lots of water slides, wave pool, etc. (although the chemicals in the water were very strong and wrecked our swimming costumes).-Beach was much nicer than I expected, with soft sand and clear water in the lake.Cons:-We got a lot of flea bites when we were in our villa. I presume these came from the stray cats that are all over the site, and who like to sit on the patio furniture. Between the fleas and the mosquitoes, we pretty much got eaten alive.-The level of supervision with some of the children\\'s activities left a lot to be desired. We were particularly concerned about our children being left to fasten themselves to the zip wires without a member of staff checking that they were attached securely.-As with all Centerparcs villages, the on-site food shop is an absolute rip-off. There\\'s a large Carrefour supermaket in Laon, which is 15 minutes by car and well sign-posted. Perfect if you\\'ve got a big family to feed.Although we enjoyed our week here, we all agree that it didn\\'t feel quite like a Centerparcs. Unlike the villages we\\'ve been to in Belgium and Holland, this one doesn\\'t have a Market Dome with flamingos and stepping stones in a stream, and there is no Grand Cafe where you can sit and have a quiet drink.

Overall though accommodation was fine, spacious with comfortable beds. My top tips for anyone visiting would be to be organised, book your activities before you arrive and bring food with you. We stayed Monday to Friday and there seemed to be fewer activities than at the weekends and they all got booked up very quickly. The restaurants were expensive and seemed to have very odd opening times. On the positive side the pool was fantastic, clean and with plenty of slides etc. The lifeguards here were also very good. Taking all the pros and cons into account we did have a really great week and I would happily go back and I do recommend it.

The drive was by easy from Calais (2.5 hrs) and the kids loved the Euro Tunnel.The village was nice, but felt quite quiet, roads were used by cycles and golf buggies here. We booked a renovated premium cottage for 2x adults and 2x kids. While it had clearly had a lick of paint, there were certainly some original features like the kitchen cupboards. The kitchen was well equipped, but only had a microwave rather than an oven, the patio on waterfront was large, but sadly not used as much as we planned due to the weather. The beds had foam mattresses, so more suited to those that sleep on their backs.If you only require the subtropical paradise swimming facilities and a self catering lodge in a Forrest, it is totally comparable with the uk and at a good price. There is a beach on the lake, a (tired) playground, a huge soft play with an arcade, a French kids show and mini disco and a very small farm (all for free/included).Extras however really lacked in comparison - it was like they were running an off peak timetable. During our time there, ALL the activities we would have booked, occurred on Thursday PM. My husband had cleverly got round the issue with the French app, by entering a French address, and we had assumed that they only released a number of activities in advance (to book), and there would be more once we got there. There wasn\\u2019t! So we managed a electric boat ride Wednesday and seperated on Thursday, my son and husband attending the Buggy Tour, while I took my daughter for a pony ride. Missing out on go ape equivalent and quad bikes. The buggy tour was great and good fun. The pony ride however was shambolic. The poor things paddock was completely waterlogged, a couple of horses were sick so there were too many children booked, the rest were reasonably reluctant to go for a walk. The parents had to lead the horses by the head reins, without a lead, which given the height of the ponies (small) was quite difficult and the walk was only up the road and then back again, nothing in the Forrest. The horses were desperate to stop and graze on the grass they passed, resulting in one child falling off!Other activities that were available were mini golf (indoor and outdoor) and bowling, which were as expected and available all the time.The aqua Munro (subtropical paradise), was fabulous and met all our expectations, we spent a lot of time in there. A Splash park with several slides, jets and a huge bucket tipping every 5 minutes. Waves in the main pool every half an hour, I believe, a lazy river and rapids outdoor, and 7 further slides.

Would definitely recommend this place to other families. ProsLocation is so easy to get to from Calais! Only 2.5 hours. Beautiful calm setting by a lovely lake. When sun is shining it\\u2019s magnificent! Loads of wildlife/ fresh air. Great for cycling. We had a renovated lake side VIP cottage which was very nice. But we were missing a kettle and cheese grater ! Near medieval town of Laon which is very pretty but a little quiet in April. Staff are polite and friendly but not that many people around to help if you need it. ( except in Aqua Mundo). There is a what\\u2019s app number you can message if you have a non urgent query. Great Aqua Mundo ! Nice and warm and Loads to do but did get a little busy at times... Nice spa. I had a facial which was very pleasant. Restaurants were what you\\u2019d expect but a little limited on choice and more for mass catering rather than true French cuisine. We ate in the pizza/ pasta and the grill only. There is a free under 4 menu which was perfect for our little boy. I wanted a local cuisine restaurant nearby that we could visit. Perhaps there would have been some better choice in Laon but they didn\\u2019t seem to open until 7 pm and it was a bit too late for the children.  If we went again we\\u2019d consider bringing a little BBQ. Cons Queue for reception can be annoying to book activities... because UK phones don\\u2019t connect to their app. Lack of extra activities ( aside from Aqua Mundo). we booked the \\u2018 go ape\\u2019 type climbing for our 5 year old and a 3 year old. I also booked a ticket for my husband. It was over 30\\u20ac in total and in the end only my 5 year old did it because it was too high for the 3 year old. I felt this was not explained very well when I booked it so I queried this back at Reception and they offered us a voucher to use instead which we thought was a good gesture. Kids Play parks are looking a little dated now but kids didn\\u2019t mind too much. Farm was a little small smelly and no hand washing facilities. Put shoes on Before going out on decking at the cottage as ours gave our kids loads of splinters. Had to remind staff on the happy hour prices in the bowling bar. Drinks were pretty expensive in general. Especially if you like a beer or 2 and a couple of soft drinks for the kids. I read on the website that this CP will be closed from sept 18 til Feb 19 for renovation so it would be good to know what they are planning to renovate? Thanks you CP for a nice break !

We had such a great time here. We stayed in a refurbished comfort cottage and it was lovely. Plenty of room. Could have done with a stair gate downstairs. We heeded the advice of other reviewers and took our own pillows and towels. We also took teatowels, which are needed. The park is set on a beautiful natural lake - this centre Parcs feels much more natural than, say, Woburn, which feels like a bit of a housing estate in comparison. There is so much to do - the aqua dome is awesome (and empty if your half term does not correspond with with everyone else\\u2019s, like Brighton\\u2019s). So many slides, something for everyone. There is a lovely sandy beach on the lake, a mini \\u201cfarm\\u201dwith goats and sheep, a free indoor soft play/climbing area, a great huge big playground. For kids aged 1 and 5 it was perfect. We hired bikes, one with a trailer to get around for about \\u00a345 for 5 days. We mostly ate at home - the on site boulangerie/patisserie does great bread and pastries, and rotisserie chickens, which are great as the comfort cottages don\\u2019t have ovens. We only tried the pizza place once, which was nice. Under 2s get a good free meal. On site shop is eye wateringly expensive (\\u00a32.50 for a cucumber??) but we paid for the convenience of not having to leave the park, and as we mostly ate at home we justified it. We loved this centre Parcs so much we\\u2019re going back next year.

Whilst we were there, there were a group of 200 approx. people on a company function that swamped the area as they were taking part in activities. At one point they all ascended near to the beach. It changed the dynamics of the park as it is meant for families not business functions.  They should not allow them at peak time.It was difficult at times to get simple things like a boat, half the time they were tied up not being used so that was really frustrating.  The paintballing was only 15minutes as they only provide you with 50 paint balls ! The quad biking was 15 minutes only so by the time they warm up and get used to it, its time to come off. The reception staff were helpful and speak English, but staff in the restaurants struggle to understand and with my lack of French it made ordering food difficult at times.  They seem to have limited patience as well.  Talking of food there are basically 2 restuarants to choose from and a buffet.  The pizza and pasta place is definitely the best place to eat.  Do not bother with the other place it is full of spiders, cobwebs, when I went to pay the additional bill for our drinks I was horrified to look up to the ceiling and see holes and damp spots and spiders it put me off eating there again. The crepery is nice but only as a snack option. We ate at the buffet once and it literally turned by stomach, the prawns smelt awful, the carved ham was left with a knife sticking out of it, nobody to carve it off for you. The curry type thing the meat looked raw.  I ended up eating bread and butter and a few things off the salad bar.  The chocolate fountain was a nice touch, but nothing but cereal or ice cream to put with it ! I wished I had catered myself but wanted a break from cooking so went for the half board option.  We managed a day out to Euro Disney which I highly recommend its quite straight forward to get to.  The aqua mundo pool is amazing, the children spent most of there time going down the various slides, it does get extremely busy.  The highest number of people we saw on the people counter was 1200, the lowest 300.  They allow too many people down the rapid river at once so you end up with feet and god knows what in your face ! And if you have little ones it is quite worrying to have a grown man going full speed towards them.  We did end up with a few bruises and grazes.Overall, the children loved it simply for the aqua mundo and the activities.  But I do not think I would return,  The whole place needs a good clean up, it looks tired and uncared for in parts.  Its such a shame, it could be amazing and be a 5 star park but I feel it has a long way to go. My suggestion would be a Chinese, Mexican, American type eating place to give people choice, possibly a sushi or noodle type place.  A good tidying up and staff around to help or advise would be nice.  I didn\\'t see 1 person cleaning the whole of my visit. Or any staff around helping, you had to queue in reception for 30 minutes to ask anything.  There are too many cars parked and driving around which is annoying as its meant to be a car free park, some cars had parking type tickets on them but they were there for days so were just ignored.Easy to get too from Folkestone - Calais - by car.", "title": "Great activities, but 3 star accomodation - disappointing", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 6, 2017", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2017"},

Several matters of concern need drawing to people\\'s attention which we feel should and could have been avoided. Firstly, I emailed the reception staff 2 months before the start of our holiday asking what the process was for reserving a golf buggy (4 person type). I was told it was not necessary to reserve a golf buggy in advance but to just visit the hire centre when we arrived. I was quoted a cost of \\u20ac215 for a 4 person buggy. On arrival at the hire centre I was told because we had not reserved a 4 person buggy in advance we could only hire a 6 person buggy at a cost of \\u20ac270 a difference of \\u20ac55. Our second complaint was the state of the garden area to cottage 551. We let our five year old grand daughter play in the garden whilst we unloaded the car. When she came into the cottage her shoes were covered in dog poo. It took up one hour of our holiday time to pick up various piles of dog poo and remove them from the garden and a further hour to clean and disinfect the cottage floor.Our third and most serious and concerning matter was that while our two grand children, 5 years and 4 years old, were playing in front of the cottage the five year old said she had something stuck into her shoe. Imagine our shock, horror and concern when she pulled out a syringe that was embedded in the side of her shoe and handed it to us. She obviously had no idea what it was but we did! We went to the reception desk and asked Cl\\u00e9mont if we could speak to the duty manager about the incident. Even though we made this reasonable request to Cl\\u00e9mont several times he would not contact the duty manager. He took a brief note of the details of the incident and arranged for a gardener to come and collect the discarded syringe. Fearing that the syringe could have contained contaminated blood, we disposed of the shoes in the bulk waste bin. How could Center Parc allow this to happen?

The journey from Calais was very easy if you follow the satnav. First impressions of the cottage were great - before we got in, they are all very pretty from the outside. Unfortunately things were not so great inside - the first thing that hit us was the musty smell in the kitchen, it really was quite strong and we could smell in the open plan living room downstairs and on the stair case. The cleaning really was not up to standard, there were cobwebs all over the place, and I was horrified when my 9 month old managed to pull a load of old fluff and hair from the gap between the laminate floorboard and the breakfast bar. The smell was remedied by bleach being put down the sink and an air freshener from Carrefour at Laon (worth a visit for shopping, not too far and a good range and much better value than the onsite shop). We got used to the cottage after the underwhelming first few hours but after a few nights found the sofa quite uncomfortable and the mattresses very uncomfortable - sore backs all round.We quickly unloaded and packed, very impressed with the wardrobe space. There was a built in stair-gate, which was a fantastic idea, but was let down by a shoddy repair job where a block of wood and been half-heartedly screwed over the split wood of the original gate.Oh dear, things were not going to plan. Then we went to the pool and suddenly all seemed well again - it really was fantastic. The play-area for children, la maison d\\'eau, was brilliant on its own, add large pool with waves, numerous slides, a lazy river and a &quot;savage&quot; river (the rapids), all under a glass dome, and you realise Center Parcs really have aced the pool. I couldn\\'t decide if the lifeguard\\'s &quot;hands-off&quot; approach was good or not - it meant I got to go down slides with my 7 year old which is something that you tend not to be allowed to do at home - but on the flip side it got my wondering if they were paying attention - maybe I am just used to the constant whistles of the lifeguards in the UK. We ate at the Jardin on the first night - the on site pizza and pasta restaurant. The chap who served us - who we suspected might be a manager or supervisor, was brilliant and the food was surprisingly good for the budget option. We ate again just before we left - literally just before we hit the road - but unfortunately the service was not as good this time. I was particularly annoyed to be told with a gallic shrug that there was no high chair available. I got one myself from the closed breakfast cafe - we were also ignored when requesting the bill and attempting to pay.The kids activities were all fantastic - the chef and secret agent experiences were staffed by enthusiastic staff,and despite my 7 year old not speaking french he was looked after well and put with other British children. He also had a go on the enfant quad bikes and had a great time - again staff were brilliant. There is a small outdoor water play area in this area which is great and a nice touch. My better half took the kids to the indoor soft play which was good - especially considering it was free.I also took the 7 year old on the offroad buggy experience - guide was good, buggys were well maintained and fun but I did feel like we spent a lot of time on tarmac rather than dirt track.We also ate at the lakeside grill restaurant - it was a saturday night and the usual menu had been replaced by a Barbecue. This sounded - and smelt - superb but we were extremely disappointed with the food. I really would avoid the saturday barbecue but couldn\\'t comment on the other menu (looked good though). Service was good.To summarise, the cottages are quite cute but are in need of a spruce - I think they are just tired and well used. As with Center Parcs in the UK, you\\'re really paying for the pool and other activities which were excellent. If you\\'re first concern in a family holiday is entertaining the kids then Le Lac d\\'ailette is a smart choice - but consider paying for premium accommodation.", "title": "Poor accommodation, fantastic pool, occasionally service was &quot;french&quot;", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 5, 2017", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2017"},

Easy 2 1/2 drive from Calais. Stop in laon to get supplies in the carrafour there. 20 mins later drove into centre parts. Easy check in. Straight to our cottage, 265 which is a bit of a trek but we hired bikes. Refurbished cottage. All ok as not in it much. However small niggles, no oven. Not much cutlery, fan not working, sink plug does not fit, only 2 rubbish bags, no big mugs, front door needs to slam to shut, fridge interior damaged,floor quite dirty. However we found the cottage comfy and cool as it was quite warm sometimes outside. We could not book activitys at home so had pot luck when we got there. There is an app to download but you can\\'t if your from outside France which is quite annoying as you can book everything on that instead of queuing. We done the indoor golf, don\\'t bother! Electric boat which was good as the lake is massive and you can go and see a bit more, but the life vests were damp and very smelly. My son done the donkey ride, 8 donkeys with 1 member of staff walking around the complex made for interesting watching as she walked off with the first two and left all us quite some way behind as the donkeys just kept wanting to stop and eat!! I done the aerial adventure. Got harnessed up, walked over to the tree, shown how to keep safe and off I went. No one to make sure or even up there to check. A mum was letting her two daughters go and she was not to impressed. I never spoke to anyone after either. Had to take my harness off myself and hang it up. Whilst watching the zip wire people were left hanging if they had not made the end as no one was there. Shocking state of safety I believe.  Swimming is great tho.a massive complex with loads of flumes. Our four year old done the rapids which I at first thought he is to young but 1- he was really good 2-he was not the youngest. Babies going down on there parents lap and stopping it or going slow causing accidents happened all the time. It\\'s a quick water rapid not a lazy river! It is always busy but lots to go on. Lots of leaves in the water from the trees growing in there which could do with cleaning out. We ate in the Italian which was good and use the parc market for a lunch and cake which was very nice. I am saying all the bad parts. Would I go again , probably but maybe another one in France. As I have only ever been to elveden I only have that to compare it to.

I always read all the trip advisor reviews so was a little nervous about what to expect given some of the more unfavourable comments posted. In reality we were delighted with what we found and had a brilliant week with our two girls aged 7 and 10. The accommodation was absolutely fine and fit for purpose and we were in Zone 1 which was a manageable walk to all the facilities- go for zero or 1 for the shortest distance if you don\\'t choose a cottage on the lakeside. We went for a refurbished cottage and it was clean and well kept. Nothing to complain about and the fact that on an activity holiday you shouldn\\'t really be spending any significant time in the house else what is the point??The location of the resort is beautiful and the views over the lake are awesome- especially at sunset. The children did the following activities- pedalo, pony riding, cool jump, high adventure, bungee trampoline, aqua speed, mini golf indoor and outdoor and spent many happy hours in the arcade haemorrhaging money whilst we enjoyed late afternoon beers overlooking the lake. All the staff running the activities were brilliant. Very friendly and a special mention to the guys who did the aqua speed- they were fantastic!!!!The Aqua Mundo was the highlight of the week. Amazing pools, lazy river and plenty of choice of different slides plus the River Sauvage which ours absolutely loved even though it\\'s not as \\'wild\\' as the name might suggest. The only one bad experience was the meal on our last night in the Italian which was absolutely shocking- and we are not the type of people to complain about anything so that should indicate how bad it had to be for us to refuse to pay!

V little noise from neighbours, maybe we were lucky+ great Aqua Munro swimming pool. Loads of slides, albeit very tame compared with uk, fine for the younger kids though+ cheap Italian restaurant with tasty pasta (although risotto v bland)+ comfy beds+ so much wildlife - bats, geese, swans, ducks, nutria (like beavers) and even a cat who had her kittens during our stay (great for us, she used us as a base, but not so good if you don\\'t like cats)+ we actually didn\\'t find the language barrier an issue. Just tried as much as we could in French and then they take pity on you and speak English! + well stocked on site shop. Yes a little more Pricey but the convenience of that vs driving to the local Carrefour, 20 mins away, we actually decided to stay on site. Just the faff of getting the car, driving 20 mins, trudging around a supermarket , 20 mins back, finding a space (v busy) and bringing the bags back to the villa put me off vs walking to the local shop and paying perhaps \\u00a310 - \\u00a320 more. + dolce gusto coffe machine in kitchen + a filter coffee remember to bring coffee pods and filters/ground coffee if you like coffee!+ the baths has hot tub setting which our kids loved - adding bubbles is extra fun if you\\'re prepared to clean up the mess!!- lakeside next to our villa a bit dirty and one daughter got stuck in the muddy \\'quicksand\\' so paddling not an option, the nearby beach area good though.- villa in need of renovating. All a bit shabby. Good enough but not great.- not even a hand towel is provided so we had to use our constantly wet swimming towels for hands. - only a combi microwave oven is provided so when we bought pizza from the shop for the first evening we could only cook 1 at a time and ruined the first 2 as they wouldn\\'t cook properly. A set of instructions would have been great because I had no idea how to work this thing. it gives you 3 automatic options but who knows what each one is. What I would bring next time?

We were originally booked for the brand new park and weren\\'t thrilled about being moved here just a couple of weeks before our holiday (especially since it took 5 days from receiving an email saying the park wouldn\\'t be ready and actually speaking to someone about our options). I then read reviews on here and got worried about some of the comments.In the end, we had a great time. We had never done this type of holiday before, so had to make an educated guess as to what to bring. We stayed in a lake view premium cottage in section 4, which was a 15 minute walk from the centre of the park.The kitchen had all the pots and pans necessary for cooking (As noted by many others, there is no oven.) It was fully stocked with cutlery and cooking utensils, plates, bowls, cups, mugs etc. There was a basic kitchen pack with 2 bin bags, 3 dishwasher tabs, a sponge and a couple of cleaning cloths. In the cupboards we found brooms, a vacuum, clothes airer and plenty of hangers. There were only 2 loo rolls, so were glad we brought some and also extra bin bags for our daughter\\'s nappies.The cottage was clean and tidy with good wardrobe space in each bedroom. The beds were comfortable and shower had very good water pressure.The facilities at the park were great for keeping our toddler happy and exhausting her so she slept better than at home!We spent a couple of hours each day in the Aqua Mundo- our toddler loved the lazy river and the mini water slides in the baby pool. We found the best time to go was first thing when it opened at 10am. The river was definitely too busy for me to feel safe with our toddler when it was crowded with older kids and teens the day we went in the afternoon. Our daughter also had a great time on the playgrounds and visiting the goats and sheep. The only way the playground could haven even better for her would have been if there were some swings.We had 2 lunches at the restaurants. At the fast food place I had a very sad looking chicken wrap which looked so unlike the photo on their display it was actually funny. We also ate at the crepe restaurant and had a lovely meal of both savoury and sweet crepes. The shop has essentials, but of course you pay a bit of a premium for it being on-site. We stopped at the hypermarket 20 minutes away and stocked up before we arrived, which worked well.The staff have been criticised in some reviews but we found them fine- especially in the crepe place and the bike hire office.

It would have been good to have more challenging sports for the teenagers but they experienced the boating and pedalo\\'s on the lake.  We found the restaurant prices similar to the UK as was the supermarket.  The deli counter for snacks and cakes was a hit with all of us.

We had the most fun in Aqua Mundo, for sure the highlight of the park.+ Aqua Mundo!!!+ Food delivery at your cottage+ Very nice location+ Indoor Playground was decent+ The colored houses are beautiful, but some could use some paint+ You receive vouchers for free activities + Good TV channel selection, with the option to play MKV movies from USB (with subtitles!)- The park often felt dirty: smell of mold in our toilet, smell of vomit+s**t in the Aqua Mundo changing room.- Lack of temperature controlling options in house: No insect screen, no airco and no fans, which meant sweaty nights, low sleep quality and little ventilation during the day. We were actually glad that we had lower temperatures (20 to 25 C max during the days). No changing of the sheets, so they must have smelled lovely after a week.- Hot water in the bathroom is extremely hot. Cold water had very little pressure. Because of this, you had to be very careful when using the faucet. The difference between way too hot and way too cold were only a few millimeters apart. - Very expensive for what you get, we expected more. We paid close to 1800 EUR to a week in a 4 person cottage.- Even the simple things cost money or are set up in a way to squeeze more money out of you.

Inside the house smelled of stale smoke(tobacco) all the walls need washing or preferably painting. There was mould on the bathroom ceiling and bedroom walls. Not a good start!!!The main harbour focal point as seen on the advertising looked drab and tired, as if no effort had been made to make it look attractive for the start of the season.The two activities that my children were booked onto were not as advertised. sorbing was advertised as being outside on the beach but was inside the sports hall in a dark corner ( although they still enjoyed themselves )Then the high adventure and zipwire was under staffed and poorly managed to the point of being unsafe. Small children were left dangling on the cable with no idea what to do !!!!Although we were disappointed with the park the surrounding area was lovely and very interesting. We made the most of the cycle paths outside the park and visited WW1 sites which are well worth the visit.We found the nearest supermarket ( Carrefour ) was at Laon which offered everything at probably half the price of the market back at Centre Parcs, the medieval city and Cathedral are also worth a look around too.To conclude the park is in a lovely location but drastically needs some money and time spent on it to bring it back up to the required standard.", "title": "Not up to usual Centre Parcs  5 star standard", "rating": "2", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 1, 2017", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2017"},

This was our second European Centre Parcs and we quickly got into the swing of things, check in was seamless as we had checked in online our keys and information pack were waiting at the gatehouse when we arrived.  We had to drive the long way round to our cottage due to the one way system for cars which gave us plenty of time to see all the different styles and colours of all the cottages, which gives this Centre Parcs a very unique look.As we had booked our holiday back in January we had our pick of cottages, having carefully reviewed the map we went for a Premium (546) as it was right on the lake and a short walk to the hub of restaurants and Aqua Mundo. The site is very long, with some cottages quite a considerable distance from the main activity hub, so choose your cottage wisely or you may end up walking/cycling a very long way!  And not all cottages are situated on the main lake, there are smaller ponds etc which are not right on the water\\u2019s edge.The cottage itself was a two story, three bedroom premium, whilst we had not booked a renovated cottage it had clearly just been painted which was a nice surprise. The only niggle was that some of the bedroom doors did not shut properly because the rubber seals had been painted over, but a small niggle.  We were also fortunate to have several House Martin nesting and watched several babies take their first tentative flight during the week we were there, admittedly they did produce a lot of poo and you had to be careful where you hung your towels to dry, but given the choice of poo over pets we were glad we had the pets!The living space was good with new furniture.  The lounge area had a TV which had several English Channels (BBC1, BBC2 and CBeebies).  At previous Centre Parcs we had been provided with a DVD player so had brought plenty of films to watch to wind down at the end of our active days, but unfortunately there was none provided here and there were not ones available to hire, so we ended buying a cheap one in town, had we known we could have easily brought one from home.The kitchen was however tiny and only had room for one person at a time.  As the weather was so nice we managed to BBQ several times so were not so reliant on the tiny kitchen.  To keep the cost of the holiday down we ate at our cottage most days but had been organised and had come prepared with potential meal options and sauces etc that can easily be made on a hob.  The onsite shop is very very expensive, OK for the odd essential but you really don\\u2019t want to stock up for the week there.  The Carrefour in nearby Laon is a 15 to 20 minute drive and is massive, most staples were about half the price of the onsite shop and we only needed to do one supermarket run for week.  Beer and Wine were about a third of the price if you purchased a special offer.We did eat out once at Centre Parcs.  The pizza and pasta restaurant had the best reviews, but unfortunately they offered little for gluten intolerance so we ended up at the L\\u2019Embarcad\\u00e8re Grill restaurant and kind of wished we hadn\\u2019t bothered.  The food was mediocre at best and the service was spectacularly slow.  Either save your money and eat at your cottage or go into nearby Laon to eat.Some previous reviewers have mentioned language problems, but we didn\\u2019t have any problems.  A well-placed bonjour works wonders, but lots of staff speak passable English and it was a great opportunity for the kids to learn some basic French words.There are lots and lots of activities for offer, and the temptation is to book them all when you book your holiday (there is certainly lots of encouragement to do so on the website) however I would advise that you wait until you arrive and check out of the activities first as some of them looked a little disappointing when seen \\u201cin the flesh\\u201d (big jumping pillow and zip wire are good examples).  There is no problem to book when you are here, the information desk is manned by English speaking staff who are very helpful.  We chose not to do too many activities and just did Family Paintball, Pony Rides, Outdoor Mini Golf and Bowling but the rest of the time was spent in the Aqua Mundo or on the beach.  There is also an indoor play centre (a soft play / ball pool type set up) which was OK and always virtually empty so ours could just charge about in total freedom.So to the star of the show, the Aqua Mundo!  We were there virtually every day for a good few hours.  It does get busy at peak times (around midday) but it is open late and on a few occasions we went after an early dinner as evenings are quite.  There is LOADS of water slides and it\\u2019s all self-regulated with a traffic light system, we liked the lazy river and the rapids (even though they were not so rapid!) and the outdoor pool.  The Water House is good, but the water tidal wave that dumps on your head every 10 minutes or so was icy cold so it didn\\u2019t take long before we scurried back to the warmth of the main pool.  Whilst there are lifeguards stationed there is a more relaxed approach to health and safety which leaves you free to actually enjoy the pool and we did not observe any dangerous or anti social behaviour, even at busy times. For day trips we spent an afternoon in nearby Laon, a lovely medieval walled town.  We also splashed out on a day trip to Disneyland Paris, it took about 90 minutes to drive there on fairly simple dual carriageway type roads and this treat really helped to make out holiday special.In summary, I would strongly encourage you to give this Centre Parcs a try.  The cost alone makes this location attractive, at about half the cost of holidaying at a UK Centre Parc, even when factoring in the Eurotunnel.  The cottages are very attractively laid out (if you pick carefully) and the weather is often more reliable than in the UK.  If I am honest the only thing that really lets this Parc down is the poor restaurant options, in a country renowned for its food and drink it\\u2019s shameful that it cannot provide a better choice than it does.", "title": "Lovely Parc but pick your cottage carefully or risk disappointment", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 2, 2017", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2017"},

We looked firstly at Center Parcs in the UK but it seemed expensive so looked at options in France and the Netherlands, which was so much cheaper. We travelled as two families but booked together so we could get apartments next to each other and where allocated apartments on the lake itself. On arrival the first evening we had an explore of the huge location and unloaded the car, this was off peak so there was still a lot of work going on and our apartment smelt as if had been freshly painted, which on a hot day was a little over powering but the apartment was clean and tidy. The onsite supermarket was closed just after 1900 when it was scheduled to be open until 2000 on our day arrival which meant a mad dash to the local carrefour to get some supplies. It is essential that you have some bikes but these are well catered for through onsite hire if you cannot bring your own. We bought bikes for the kids but not us so we hired some. The kids spent loads of time in the swimming pool everyday and we are in a combination of the apartment and restaurants. The options are pretty diverse and we tried the pizza restaurant, the fast food burger restaurant, the crepe restaurant and the slightly posher burger place. All of which catered well to families. There are plenty of activities as you would expect and having prebooked some (which is essential, as booking activities on site seemed a little limited) we had something to do each day.

I recommend the local Carrefour in Laon to stock up on supplies as the onsite shop is quite expensive, which isn\\'t surprising.We picked one of the VIP villas (no 347) which had recently been refurbished and it was done to a nice standard.  Ours didn\\'t come with any sort of guest guide or instruction manuals so we had lots of trial and error.  However my friends who were staying did have one in theirs, so perhaps ours had got stolen.  The cleaners should check this though! There are plenty of bathrooms plus a sauna.  All was very clean despite other comments I read before arrival.The kitchen is quite small with an electric hob, nescafe dulce gusto, orange juice  maker,microwave oven/grill but no normal oven so pizzas are out! Unless you spend 30EUR for a pizza to be delivered to your room (which my friend advised was cold).  Obviously they want you to eat in the resort which I get however with a baby this can be tricky! The food options aren\\'t amazing onsite either.There is also nowhere to put a charcoal BBQ so we just put on the ground which wasnt ideal.  A bricked area like they have in the UK would be better.The lounge has a smart TV where you can plug in usbs great for entertainment.  There are also a few English channels like BBC.There is no air con but despite the heat the villa didn\\'t get too hot which was great.  As others have said there are a lot of bugs but that\\'s to be expected for a rural location. Just don\\'t leave your doors open in the evening  I and you\\'ll be fine.  I I took a plug in mossie repellant which seemed to do the job. They also had lovely stray cats who were really cute and looked very well fed!  My husband also spotted a beaver!We hired bikes and a trailer to get around.  It\\'s quite a small resort which is perfect for families with small kids as you can get them about easily. Our villa (non lake facing) was only 5 mins ride from the aqua Mondo and main centre which was perfect. My only gripe was they seemed quite lax in letting cars drive around with many parked outside their villas no on arrival day.  I usually love the car free riding at centre parks so they need to clamp down on this, plus it\\'s dangerous for children.Aqua Mondo is good, remember a 1 euro coin for the locker. It\\'s not a proper swimming pool so you can\\'t do lengths or much with a small baby, but they have a toddler pool if they can walk with a sand pit.  Take a sun hat for small babies as the roof lets in a lot of sunlight.We tried the buffet on the last night.  It\\'s ok, and quick and easy for families.  The food isnt the best quality but it\\'s edible.  My vegetarian friend managed to find a few things to eat despite the language barrier.  I would say it\\'s helpful to know some french as English didn\\'t seem to be that well spoken.  There also weren\\'t many Brits there (a good thing!).With a baby we couldn\\'t really do activities but we tried the soft play which was ok.  They could do with a ball pit and air con though.  Somewhere to get drinks too would be good like a cafe, as the bar downstairs was very busy and there are no staff supervising the children.Overall, the cost is much less compared to the UK, however you have a longer drive, potential language issues and fewer activities to do.  For us that was fine as we couldn\\'t do a lot with the baby anyway and it was easy to get around.  For older kids or groups of adults it may get a bit boring though.I probably wouldn\\'t come again and would stick to the UK sites.", "title": "Nice villas (VIP) but other activities could be better", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "July 11, 2017", "trip_type": "Traveled with family", "trip_date": " July 2017"},

The Grill restaurant had no steak on day 1 and we gave up on dessert as we had waited so long for the rest, the Italian had no spaghetti on day 2 and was slow, the buffet chef told us they had ice cream but the next day when we went, had none. The food is, in my opinion average, but expensive and takes and age to get hold of (despite affable service). The supermarket is ridiculously overpriced - over 7 euros for Nescafe Dolco Gusto pods that cost 3.5 euros in Carrefour (as an example).In my view, the place is great to go to in spite of the poor catering.

Although I\\'m keen to practice my French, I bottled out and allowed the representative to give us a quick induction in English.  This theme continued for the whole trip: I spoke as much French as I could, but if there was ever any difficulty, the staff supported my French learning and always offered to speak English.  All staff were friendly, helpful and approachable.The park is as pleasant and well-maintained as any other centreparcs I\\'ve been to, and was in better condition than either of the two Dutch ones I\\'d previously visited.  The restaurants are limited, but I can recommend the Italian restaurant and the Grill, both of which were really pleasant.  The Italian offers very good value.  The Aqua Mundo is the best I\\'ve been to.The kids (2 boys, aged 10 and 8) tried a variety of activities.  One note of caution regarding the high-ropes course and zip wire: the kids are on their own up there, there are no instructors up in the course.  This often led to confusion, especially for the English kids, but for everyone on occasions.  The zip wire frequently leaves people stranded and dangling, some distance from the end of the wire.  It\\'s not much of a problem, once you know what to do, but it takes the fun out of it somewhat.  My kids still went back and did it again the next day.The shop is, as has been previously mentioned, expensive. Try not to compare prices with your local Tesco, instead think about how much money you\\'re saving by not going to a restaurant.  You can go to a hypermarket (e.g. in Laon) before you arrive, and you\\'ll minimise your expenditure in Centerparcs.All cottages are being refurbished.  We had a choice when booking of paying extra for one which has already been refurbished, or one which had a lake view.  We opted for the lake view (553) and we were happy with our choice.  It was a short walk to the centre, was very close to the football pitch.  If you\\'re able to tolerate a bit of paint peeling off the walls, then you\\'ll be fine with this.  If not, then choose an upgraded one.  It was small by comparison to other ones I\\'ve stayed in, but good enough.  We took a couple of trips out, to Laon and to Reims.  Their both easy to get to, and worth a look around.  There are some nice cycle paths immediately outside the resort, which I took the kids out on each day.I\\'ve seen one or two reviews commenting that the staff were unfriendly/hostile to non-French speakers.  I saw none of that.  I tried to speak as much French as I could, and accompanied it with an apologetic smile when I was struggling.  I think making an effort with locals is always important, and this place is no different.  Everyone was friendly.  If you\\'re game for a different Centreparcs experience, rather than a run-of-the mill one, then this place will not disappoint.

After reading reviews on here we were a bit worried about our decision to visit but we needn\\'t have been concerned. We stayed in a refurbished lake view cottage which was both modern and clean. The position overlooking the lake couldn\\'t have been beaten especially as we were fortunate enough to have good weather. The cottage was well equipped although the kitchen was small &amp; didn\\'t have an oven so you had to be imaginative with what you cooked. The shop on site was well stocked and actually very reasonably priced when compared to the Carrefour in Laon which is the neatest place to shop off site. The bakery on site did great baguettes and croissants. The aqua mundo was much bigger than the pools at the UK sites we have visited. There were lots of slides &amp; plenty to keep my nephew and niece aged 8 and 4 occupied for hours. We got three free activity tokens with our booking, and so tried bowling, badminton and pedals which were all very good. There is a lovely beach area, a children\\'s farm, a few playparks and plenty of organised activities. We felt it was better than the UK sites as there was plenty to do without having to spend a fortune on activities. We ate out one evening at the Italian which was very nice, and we felt reasonably priced. A pizza was 10-13 euro each which we felt seemed about the same as you would pay in England. There are a few restaurants to choose from which are all located near the lake and have outside seating, which again we felt was better than the UK sites we had visited. The bar was pretty expensive so this could be improved. There is some entertainment but it is mainly in French so we didn\\'t go along to it. All in all, at the end of our trip we feel that we would recommend this site to others &amp; that we would consider visiting again ourselves. We felt it was better value for money than the UK sites we have been to at Elvedon and longleat, and at only a two hour drive from Calais just as accessible. The location around the lake can\\'t be beaten &amp; we would highly recommend the lakeview cottages. From this site it looks like there are varying viewpoints but we would say go along and see for yourself.

I have to say it was less than half the price of the UK Parcs and that included the Fuel and Eurotunnel. Prior to arrival I had been trying to get prices for the activities, High Ropes Course, Archery, Quad Biking etc. We called, several times, I emailed, several times, but got no reply. I resorted to Facebook and a cleaner who works at the site emailed me back with some ideas of prices. Never had any contact back from the park. On arrival, all was well, we got our keys, drove to the cottage and unloaded the car, no more than 10 mins later I had a warning posted on my car that it needed to be moved as no cars were allowed in the parc. We had barley unpacked the car. Nether less I moved it, however it was a 20 minute walk back from the very nearest car park space to our cottage, a real shame considering I knew I was going to make a Intermarche (Supermarket) run later that day. Every time we went out of the park to go shopping etc we had to negotiate with the security guys to get back in with the car. On a couple of occasions, we were told no, one occasion saw us carrying several bags of food shopping the 20 mins back to the cottage. The car park really was badly placed and when the 00\\u2019ss of day visitors arrived the car park got full quick. Of course we could have hired a golf buggy, but these were 220 Euros for the week!Our cottage was 580, a Premium Cottage for 5/6 people, we travelled with my mum, my wife and our two teenage daughters. The cottage could have done with a clean, floor was gritty and the walls had marks on them, generally it was OK though. We learnt the hard way on the first night not to leave any of the lights on when you go out. We left the landing light on and came back to thousands of midges and flies in the bedrooms, which we spent 1.5hours hoovering up! The cottage was big enough, more than. The kitchen was small and has no Oven, so cooking is limited to the Hob and Microwave. Most people had their own gas BBQ or disposable ones. Its was comfy well laid out, but as I mentioned, could have done with a refurb. We found out in the week that a large number have been refurbed. Our friends went in the summer and had a VIP cottage, aside from free WiFi they got rolls delivered, although they said not enough. They also had a Sauna in the cottage, but only used it once.The parc was great, nice lakes, despite been 20 mins each way the walk to the center of the parc was nice, all landscaped and lots of wildlife. The golf buggies ruined it a bit as they seem to buzz around everywhere and you had to avoid them. The Pool was brilliant, although if you have young kids watch out as the lifeguards seemed disinterested in the groups of teenage lads throwing themselves several at a time down the water flumes or stopping in the middle of them. There were several water slides and a rapid river. The pool generally was quiet about 1.5 hours before closing time. Lunchtimes was almost full to capacity every day.Food wise, we cooked and eat out, can highly recommend the Buffalo Grill in Laon, like a harvester, but much better and such friendly staff, despite my daughter doing A levels I French they all spoke English, we actually had to ask them to speak French to let her practice. There is two big supermarkets in Laon. There\\u2019s also an amazing Cathedral, not that we planned it or that we are religious, but its incredibly impressive. The Italian Restaurant was the best we found, service was painfully slow, 1 hour wait for food, but it was fresh and nice. The Grill was a rip off, very expensive and we had a very rude and unhelpful Italian Waiter, working in a French Centre parcs, who spoke very little French and no English, we struggled to order Steak and Chips, I\\u2019m pretty sure he was coming to the end of a shift, a bad one, and we got the bac end of it! The All you can eat buffet was pricey, 21 Euros for adults and the food looked like Hospital food on hot plates, we avoided eating here. Drink Wise I was massively disappointed. I bought in the supermarket a 5Litre Keg of Desperados Beer for 12 Euros and a box of Red Wine for 6 Euros. The wine I the bars was around 5 Euros a glass and the Desperados Beer was 7 Euros! Even Heineken was 5.50 Euros, equivalent of about \\u00a34.50 at the time! Shocking. On the Tueday night I was thankful of our stash of booze as the bar ran out off all alchaholic drink with the exception of Sparkling Rose and Local Cider! We took our own beer and wine into the bar and no one said a word. We did not advertise it, but we did not hide it either. For a quieter time in the evening sit in the Tropical Dome or upstairs in the kids play area, its huge and was quieter than the bar that seemed to have either Football or Tennis on permanently. The activities were all good, if you hold a driving license I recommend the off road buggy driving, 45kmh 4x4 off Road buggies, really god fun, but you will get dirty. High Ropes was OK, we climb at home so not too exciting for us and the instructors seemed to be letting kids on that clearly did not meet the minimum height, only a problem when they could not reach the next bit!Paintballing was a joke, although it was real Gas powered paintballing guns, I had asked prior as I did not want to do it with my 13 yr old daughter if it was real paintballing. No one told us. It was basically me, my 13yr old, two girls fresh from the gym in gym clothing and two 10ish year old lads, we got put in a team against 7 20 odd year olds on a Rugby tour. After been shot in the head 3 times we quit! I did not get a refund despite complaining as we signed up for Kids paintballing.The Segway tour was great, never done it before, took to it easy, as did everyone else. Just under 1 hour tour of the parc, little bit of off road. Really good fun. We found most of the activities to be pretty pricing for what they were. You may be better off booking in advance was what we were told, but I did not do this as we did not know what we may want to do on any given day, we kind of thought we would wait to see what the weather was like. In comparison Belgium Centre Parcs De Vossemeren seems to be half the price for the same things?VERDICT:All in all, had a good holiday, but would not go back to this Parc. We have booked Belgium for 2017 as friends have been a few times and always rave about it. As a side line I emailed Centre Parcs De Vossemeren, Belgium and have had prices for the activities, all of which are around half the price of France. They also gave me loads of details about the park and accommodation and even recommended various cottages.  TOP TIP: Ask for a Recently Refurbished Cottage. Book your activities on the arrival day, otherwise, as with us, you may find that they are full when you go to book. Stop at the Supermarkets in Laon on the way there to buy food and drink. We snuck a peak into Comfort accommodation and it really was no different, although apparently you had to take your own bedding or pay for it.", "title": "May 1 Week Family Holiday", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "February 13, 2017", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2016"},

Ours was about an 800m walk to Aquamundo along the lake-front and the back of the beach so we didn\\'t need bikes or a golf cart but the place is big and the farthest cottages are a long way out.Cottage:We had a 4 person lakeside VIP cottage but not one of the new design versions. Reading some of the other reviews this had me nervous but although the paint on the balustrade was peeling, and there were some wobbly doorhandles and creaky hinges, most of the interior and furnishings were in good shape for a rental. Beds and bedding were comfortable.Our veranda was right on the lake with a coot\\'s nest a few meters out. Ducks, including a dozen tiny ducklings, swans, and a large coypu (rangondin in French) were regular visitors, and there were swallows overhead, and grebes further out in the lake.A word of warning - the cottage can get hot pretty quickly and being on the lake there are plenty of insects about. If you\\'re going to open things up to cool down you\\'ll probably need some kind of anti-mosquito plug-in (which they don\\'t sell in the shop).Aquamundo:Aquamundo was excellent. Lazy river is long and tranquil. Outdoor pool section a bit small but nice and sunny and with extra-warm water. The indoor pool is standard Center-Parcs with waves on the hour (for a couple of minutes). The crazy river is great fun as long as it\\'s not too crowded.There are around 8 slides in the main section - 3 reached by dedicated steps, three going from a pool just below the crazy river, one starting beside the crazy river entrance and one half way down the crazy river. None are extreme - all rated either over 6 or over 8 years old - so kids can have great fun on these. Maybe a little tame for thrill-seekers but good fun still. There is a dedicated section of the dome for toddlers with more slides.In terms of crowding things can get pretty busy but not unbearable. During the local school holidays families arrive en-masse from the 10am opening. Lunchtime can get a bit quieter and an hour or so before closing seemed to be a good time as by then many families on day trips had burnt-out and left for the day. Lots of locals visit Aquamundo at the weekends and during the local school holidays. If you can avoid the local school holidays it will be less crowded, at least on weekdays.NB: You need 1 Euro coins for the lockers. The biggest lockers are only big enough for maybe two people\\'s stuff.Facilities:Service at the main desk (to book activities) was very quick. On our previous Center Parcs visits in summer the queues were enormous for this but in the Easter Holiday here there never seemed to be queues to book activities. Whether this is due to the time of year or the site staffing levels I don\\'t know, but it was a pleasant surprise.The on-site shop has a pretty good range of stuff but prices are around double the going rate.The Italian restaurant has plenty of choice. Service when we were there (Easter school holidays) was friendly and lightning fast lunchtime and evenings. No shortage of tables.Smaller kids can enjoy the artificial sand beach by the lake. The sand is fine and clean and there\\'s plenty of room. There\\'s an little place at the top of the beach for drinks and ice creams. Only complaint was that this closed too early (it\\'s a beautiful spot to be at sunset) and was closed all Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Easter holiday visit", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "April 10, 2017", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " April 2017"},

One De Eemhoff, our favourite, we love! However this is by far the best European CP yet in our opinion! 2.5 hours drive from Dunkirk. Much nicer experience than Calais. And DFDS nicer ferries with huge kids areas!! We read other reviews before our trip, and were worried about the chalets being scruffy and dirty etc so we booked a newly refurbished one. Number 208! We were pleasantly surprised with our chalet upon arrival. Modern and clean. There was lots of dust however behind the doors of every room, didn\\'t cause us a problem, but it was nice. Had a new feeling to it! The kitchen area was very small but adequate. There was loads of glasses and cups and plates etc. But only 2 cereal bowls. 4 knives and forks and 6 teaspoons!! 3 steak knives were the only chopping knives plus a bread knife. So cutting potatoes and carrots was tricky! We hired a golf buggy which was pricey but huge fun, our kids loved it! It\\'s quite hilly so we didn\\'t miss the bikes. The dome is very modern compared to other European Parcs we\\'ve been to. And whilst not quite up there with uk standards it\\'s the best we\\'ve experienced in Europe by far! We didn\\'t eat out there so can\\'t comment on their restaurants. The aqua mundo is fantastic. The best yet! Great lazy river that goes on for miles and outside! Rapids were quite tame but also very rapid like!! With sections going off in different directions and slides too. Which brings me to the subject of slides. There must be about 10! All brilliant and for all the family. The French are more relaxed and families of 5-6 were all going down at once. Lots of happy laughing people landing in heaps in the pool! So nice to see! The showers are hit and miss as some freezing and they all need descaling as they shoot out all over the place! Yet again never enough family cubicles! Park supermarket is great. Some things overpriced but to be expected. The rotisserie seemed very popular so we got a chicken on the last night but our 5 resident cats got most of it as it was VERY under cooked and pink! \\u20ac12.50 each but we didn\\'t fancy taking it back! Plus it was raining! We stopped at a supermarket Grand Frais in Laon on the way. It was the best supermarket we\\'ve ever been to. If they had it in the uk I\\'d shop there everyday!!! There are loads of activities to do for kids. Horse riding, bungee trampoline, paint balling, quad biking, geo cashing, zip wires, climbing, a huge jump, mini golf plus more. Our son chose to do a bungee trampoline. Upon arrival we were ignored for sometime. 20 minutes in fact while we watched loads of people getting on and off. Supposed to be a 10 minute slot but it seemed like a particular few were on for 20 minutes. By which time we were told by the extremely rude member of staff that we were too late. The seemed in our eyes to get pleasure in letting others in and looking at us like \\'hahaaaaa losers\\' if it was for me I wouldn\\'t have minded but my 7 year old son was very upset. When the next person finished I barged my way onto a trampoline and she stood in front of us shouting NO NO NO!!!! The people around weren\\'t helpful at all either as their kids bounced for 30 minutes. This awful woman was called Charline. (We\\'ve since noticed that she\\'s normally with the horses. Watch out for her!) We complained to the outdoor activity desk and the very nice chap gave us a refund. My son was too upset to go back. Not what you expect on holiday. And he let us play mini golf for free and we had huge fun! He also agreed with us that she was very rude but what can he do?! I hope her managers see this. I treated myself to a massage! It was wonderful in the spa by a lovely girl called Rebecca. I could have stayed all day! The girl on the spa desk called Lucie was lovely and very helpful finding me the right treatment!! It wasn\\'t cheap though \\u20ac148! But I deserved it! My son and husband used the spa on Sunday morning. Between 10-12 when kids over 8 are allowed in they loved it! We can\\'t wait to go back!!

We have stayed in the basic units both times and found them perfectly adequate. The TV has an SD card slot in it, so you can take movies for the kids to watch in the evening. There are also UK TV channels this year.Tips (to avoid the cons):1.\\tThe resort is quite spread out, look for the resort map online before you book and then reserve the chalet that suits your mood for walking, costs a bit extra but well worthwhile \\u2013 it can be quite hilly for the little ones2.\\tRe the hills, the roads are a little bumpy, so watch your little ones on bikes and scooters3.\\tThe supermarket in resort is brutally expensive, so drive through Laon on your way and stock up, that way you can drive your groceries to your doorstep on arrival rather than carrying them back from the resort supermarket every day4.\\tProvision of equipment in the chalets can be variable.

Some mixed reviews on here so we went expecting a few disappointments but it exceeded our expectations.We booked early and got a good deal including picking our cottage (went for a VIP lakeside cottage for four in zone 6) and got a few free activities (opted for table tennis and bowling). Our accommodation was fab...jacuzzi bath, sauna, wrap around veranda. Three bathrooms, towels and bedding etc on arrival....I think from reviews it\\'s worth the upgrading and this cottage particularly good for us as the decking was fenced, a must with an inquisitive 3 year old who loved the ducks, moorhens and water rats coming up to our decking in the hope of a feed.We took our inflatable kayak, bikes.... and after reviews went armed with pillows, mugs and a slow cooker though I didn\\'t really feel we needed the latter-pillows seemed fine, we had large teacups and a hob and microwave oven. A pleasant surprise too was to have a dishwasher with three tablets supplied. In places the furniture and cupboards looked a touch worn and the twin rooms sink was v slow to drain but comparable to UK Centre Parcs gripes this was minor and didn\\'t deter from our holiday. We had cottage 621, from the map and exploring the site zone 6 and 5 are well placed for the centre/beach and other well placed lakeside cottages with similar privacy/great open views would be 493, 608, 658, 726/728. All the cottages looked very pretty, New England style painted frontages, as mentioned in other reviews the site is quite vast and spread out....I kayaked a lot of the lake and biked all around so plenty to explore. Lots of play areas dotted around, farm animals, a great little water play area by port and for older kids skate parks, outdoor decks...plus for those with budding footballers a fab interactive football wall.We booked as a treat the spa and for around 30 euros had 2 hours use of lovely spa....jacuzzis, steam room, sauna and salt room plus herbal teas and loungers. Very relaxing and stylish. We also paid for pony riding and zip wire...both reasonably priced compared to UK. Only downside of zip wire was it was very high up and after initial Tuition pretty much left to it!! At times it was physically difficult for my 8yr old to move the carabenas and manage the climbing....a member of staff at each platform would have been better as lots struggled. The aqua Mundo was great, kids loved it (aged 3 and 8)....lots of slides, lazy river, play areas etc. Was busy especially at the weekend but never queued for too long for the slides.We didn\\'t really shop onsite....went into the Intermarche in Laon, about 20 mins drive but nice to get off site....as expected the onsite shops expensive. We ate out twice the better of the two restaurants was the Italian....nice pizza/pasta. Lots to do and a well laid out site, the beach area was nice....it is a lake though and a few algae blooms so didn\\'t feel great swimming out into the lake but great for paddling and chilling in the beach. All the staff all seemed to speak English though I can speak a little French so this wasn\\'t an issue. Overall a great holiday....we struck lucky with the weather, heat wave on arrival so mid 30s was too hot to go off biking, settled down to mid to late 20s. Had it been cooler we would have explored more of the locality cycling as there are a few paths off site. I would recommend it as easy to get to from Calais-straight forward toll motorway drive most of the way.

We stayed in Premium Lakeview - a family of 5, with one additional teenage friend. 4 bedroom, two bathroom (plus additional toilet) worked really well. Kitchen well equipped and everything clean on arrival. Aesthetically I think this is the loveliest Center Parcs site - massive lake and lots of coloured cottages (including 2 storey ones) - not the concrete toilet block looking things that we\\'re used to. Aqua Mundo a hit with everyone (the rapid and slides weren\\'t quite as rapid as some other Center Parcs) but still a lot of fun. We did additional paid activities of high ropes and canoeing  - all pretty good value for money, and the high ropes in particular was a great course (better than some we\\'ve seen at other center parcs location). We booked the holiday on-line which is all fairly straightforward. They have a system of &quot;toppings&quot; whereby you get some extras basically, including being able to choose cottage location. You can pre-book activities, although confusingly not some key ones, . However - we had no problem booking everything we wanted to do whilst on site. We didn\\'t use any of the on-site restaurants, and only bought a couple of things from the on site shop. Another reviewer had helpfully mentioned that there\\'s an big Carrefour on the outskirts of Laon - but it\\'s about 20 mins drive away - so worth one big shop - bearing in mind you can\\'t drive your car to the cottage other than on arrival and departure day (there is a shopping trolley provided). Other reviewers had mentioned that things were in bad repair - didn\\'t notice that - I think our cottage was relatively recently refurbished. Our decking was slightly broken and there was a slight blockage in one basin - we reported both but they weren\\'t fixed during our stay - that was the only slight downer - and although the accommodation was definitely clean - I\\'m sure there were a few stray corners that could have been cleaned a bit more thoroughly. This Center Parcs site seems quite spread out (3.7 miles round the perimeter roads - I ran it!) - depending on your location you could be a good walk away from the Aqua Mundo and the lake / beach.

This is a 4 bed VIP cottage that was situated within a 5-10 minute walk from the main hub. We opted not to have lake side as we wanted some outside space for our young children. I don\\'t believe this is a newly renovated cottage, and we didn\\'t pay the extra for one. I must say, we were really pleased with the accommodation, it was spacious and clean. There were areas that could do with a touch up with some paint, but certainly nothing that would detract from overall feel. Wrapped around two sides was a lovely secluded deck area looking out into woods (the beach was also visible through an opening) - see photos. The outside furniture was rattan chairs, table and sun loungers - all of good quality and felt quite new. There was a sauna in the back, but we were blessed with scorching weather, so it wasn\\'t used. As for the rest of the park, it was great. Amazing aqua centre with loads of slides, a lazy river, rapids and outside pool. We were in it every day and the kids loved it. There\\'s loads of activities to choose from and were reasonably priced. The supermarket was convenient but expensive. The restaurants were expensive with food that was reasonable. We did visit the hypermarket in Laon, it\\'s about a 20 minute drive, definitely worth stocking up on food,  beer and wine for your whole stay as it\\'s quite cheap but it was a little stressful and chaotic, so I wouldn\\'t recommend making multiple trips.

There were plenty of other free activities including the brilliant baluba indoor play. We found the paid activities quite expensive but enjoyable nonetheless.  Partly due to the exchange rate the park was overall quite expensive but the accommodation was a lot cheaper than the UK parks.

It didn\\'t matter too much for us... we mostly just slept and ate in the lodge! My tips would be to pop to a supermarket before arriving. The park shop is over priced.

Booking: easy to book, however, no one told us about the restriction list of the free activities that came with our booking, we found out on arrival only, which was not so helpful. Cottages: on arrival, after having driven since 7am from London and expecting a home from home experience as in Centre Parcs Elveden (England),  we were presented with a cottage that was dusty, unclean, unkept and in complete need of refurbishment. After speaking to a lovely at reception, we were allocated a refurbished cottage with the opportunity of a cleaning team to facilitate our needs if required. The garden of our cottage was unkept, the furniture drabby and not matching with one modern lounger and one old plastic one. Please be mindful that the Centre Parcs of Lac D\\'Ailette does not offer the same experience as in Centre Parcs in England: no oven facilities, no made beds, towels come as extras, wifi also comes as an extra. Restaurants: we wanted to enjoy eating out as a family and tried the main grill restaurant facing the lake for some traditional French cuisine. Queues are not managed, no front of house visible to swiftly manage those who wish to sit outside and those who wish to sit inside. Huge queues are formed. The service was pleasant by slow. The food portions were fine, however, our fish was uncooked in the middle and we had to return it. The prices were quite high for the quality of the food.Aqua Mundo: the main aquatic centre: the policy of taking shoes off to enter the premises is not respected by everyone, and therefore does not help with the hygiene of the place. It is not Centre Parcs\\' fault, but perhaps someone to manage it would be an idea. For the big water slides, staff was visible to watch people using them, but there was no queue management which creates overload and an unsafe environment where everyone is trying to go down at the same time. The children area was really good, except for the sand at the bottom of the water. The lac: amazingly beautiful setting, nice beach, but too much pond weed which could be managed by Centre Parcs. There are unfortunately no changing rooms or showers by the beach. The food shop: good selection, well stocked. The parc and its logistics: the website does not inform on the very many hills of the parc, which makes it very challenging for most parents with young children, which was our case. We believe this should be made explicit on the website/when booking. There is a solution which is to hire a golf like buggy at a cost of EUR200+ for the week....Overall, a beautiful lake with mature natural surroundings, however, a tiring experience, ruined by the fact that we had a personal bike stolen. When reporting to security, we were told that they did not deal with such things and that we had to speak to the reception. When speaking to reception, we asked whether there was a camera at such an integral point in front of the main complex, and in view of the security hut, and were told that we would not have access to any videos, and that security would contact us. We were then given directions to the local gendarmerie and sent on our way to deal with the issue. At no time during our stay after going to the gendarmerie, did a member of the security or the management team came to talk to us. Please note that the gendarmerie advised us that Centre Parcs was a prolific area for the stealing of bikes. If we had been informed of the security failure, we would have not, like many others, bought our own personal bikes. Again, we enjoyed the natural beautiful location, there were some very hard working and pleasant members of staff, however, we personally felt that there were many failures by the management/directorship who, as it seems, do not have their finger on the pulse.", "title": "Havens by the lake.....", "rating": "2", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 3, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2016"},

However, having just returned from a simply amazing week here, I needn\\'t have been so worried. From start to finish, the holiday was faultless. The staff were all incredibly friendly and we had a couple of experiences where customer service was exceptional. Aside from one member of staff in the snack bar, everyone we encountered spoke excellent English. The accommodation was completely adequate for what we needed. Ok, so there may have been some chips to the paint and a couple of marks on the carpet but I really can\\'t understand anyone who would let that ruin their holiday. We stayed in villa 540 which was a vip cottage with stunning lake views (some trees and shrubs partially blocking the view but still openings to see it). We were fortunate enough to have a heat wave during our visit so we spent some mornings on the beach, we hired electric boats on the lake and spent lots of time in the amazing pool (which in my opinion is better that the English Center Parcs). We received 3 activities vouchers as part of our booking and we weren\\'t entirely sure what these could be used for. When we arrived we were given a list of what we could use them on. We used one voucher for a adult to play indoor mini golf  for free( which was fab) and then we discovered our other two vouchers would allow us to hire a bike for free for our entire weeks stay. This was amazing! Compared to English Center Parcs, we found the prices very reasonable. We did our food shopping in Laon which is only 15 minutes away and we had a lovely morning out in the medieval city as well. We knew we would only get a microwave oven in our villa so we didn\\'t plan any meals which would need an oven. We did try to use the oven to heat some bread on one day but my husband and I could not figure out how to use it and subsequently burnt the bread! Had we needed to use the oven again we would have had to call someone out to explain it to us!!We are looking forward to going back to Center Parcs again next summer as we had such an amazing time!

We chose a 4-bed Premium Cottage(not newly renovated) near the lake and facilities.  It was lovely - exactly what you would expect from a holiday cottage.  Of course it had some wear and tear as it hadn\\'t been renovated but having stayed at resorts both here and in the US I wouldn\\'t say it was in any worse condition and in fact given that we had young kids we were happy to see that they spent more money on keeping the cottage clean, then repainting the walls after every visit.  Although one challenge was the website wasn\\'t great at telling you what actually came in the cottage as far as cutlery etc.. and we were pleasantly surprised here to find a fully stocked kitchen with plates, glasses etc..2) Facilities (Soft Play):  What more to say our day basically revolved around Soft Play(they have one massive area, along with another smaller soft play by some restaurants) and this free facility kept our children happy for hours on and off throughout the day.  My son especially loved the little motor cars you could put a token in and drive around the track - he is 3 and was able to do this on his own.  It was hard keeping him off.3)  Facilities (Pool):  The pool was immense - granted we\\'d never been to any other center parcs before but even though the pool had a lot of people in it, there was so many slides, water features, pools, lazy rivers both inside and outside that we had a blast.  It was also nice that as a family we could use the slides together and spend time as a group.In summary - we went with low expectations and left thinking about when we were going to coming back.  So if you - like me - are worried about the one star reviews then hopefully this review helps.", "title": "Amazing week - don\\'t let the one star reviews scare you!", "rating": "5", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 2, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2016"},

We were in cottage 348 which has a slight side lake view but we didn\\'t spend anytime on that side of the cottage as we had a lovely outdoor table, chairs and sunbeds for alfresco dining every night. We bought food with us for the week which we cooked on the stove, grill, microwave and BBQ (which we purchased for 12 euros in the onsite supermarket). We used the onsite shop for milk, fresh baguettes and a few essentials we had run out off. The weather was amazing 35 degrees nearly all week apart from today which was a little less sunny but still 28 degrees. We spent a few hours each morning on the beach as the kids loved swimming in the lake and building sand castles. In the afternoon we spent most of our time in the Aqua Mundo which was amazing so many slides to pick from, lovely outdoor infinity pool, Rapids and a great lazy river. The kids really enjoyed the swimming pool. We didn\\'t feel the need to do any activities and was quite happy spending time together and swimming/going to the beach every day!  The accommodation is tired and needs a lick of paint and a real good scrub but we come armed with cleaning stuff after reading the reviews on here. Flies and mosquitos around when leaving the windows of a night as it was so hot - no air con and no breeze was really hard to sleep some nights. We\\'ve been center parcs in the UK for the last 5 years so as long as you DONT compare then you\\'ll be fine. I would come back again and would probably book a few activities next time. Also we hired a golf buggy for the week at 270 euros and 500 euro pre authorised deposit which was pricey but the kids loved it and so did the adults. We were a little far out from the swimming pool and beach and in the really hot sun it was a god send having the buggy to use.

In fact I had been dreading getting there and spending hours cleaning on arrival. Fortunately, I was very pleasantly surprised and in the end we had a fantastic week! Best bits: swimming pool is brilliant, especially the rapids and slides, and we had many nice afternoons on the beach with lovely views. There is a good choice of activities though some were better than others. The older kids (11 and 9) really loved the aqua speed and the five year old loved the parcours ouisti (climbing about in trees), mini golf was really fun, all kids thought the skate park was great, the pony ride was lovely and at forty minutes great value. It was also nice to have such great free facilities available: for example, the playground, the farm, the DJ decks. You definitely would not need to pay for activities every day if you didn\\'t want, there are lots of free things to do. The paintball was a bit disappointing though, and as other people have commented, the high wire is not for the fainthearted. Definitely only for older and confident kids. We did not have any problems booking any activities.      The accommodation isn\\'t the most modern and was a bit dated but definitely did not have the negative experience that other people have commented on. Only slightly annoying things was that the dishwasher didn\\'t really work and the mugs were tiny (I know that is very nit picky but when you need a proper cup of tea, you need a proper cup of tea.....) It was very pretty from the outside. The living space was very big, and the bedrooms were decent, though the kitchen is on the small side. We only ate out a couple of times because as other people have said, it was fairly pricey. However, both the food and the service at the pizza restaurant and the creperie we tried were excellent. We also got a takeaway raclette and fondue one night and that was fun. I had booked early enough that we were only five minutes walk from the beach and from the swimming pool. I think if you were anywhere else, you would need bikes. Many people had rented the golf buggies which did look good though were quite expensive.  I had no problems communicating with staff. I spoke very basic French learned at school which was enough to order food and shop with, but there was only one staff member we encountered who had no English.

This was our second visit to Le Lac D\\'Ailette (last visiting 5 years ago).Until day 4 of our holiday we were having a fab time helped by the amazing weather which meant we visited the man made beach in the day and the swimming pool late afternoon. We left the swimming pool to find that two of our four bikes (my husband\\'s and 11 year old son\\'s) had been stolen from the bike park. They were locked together at the bike park opposite the main centre and bicycle centre. We were absolutely shocked and disgusted by this and my two children (11 and 8) were extremely frightened - the fear on their faces was just awful! My husband immediately reported this to the information desk where he received no sympathy. A form was filled in and he was old to report it to the police in Laon. My children wanted to come home as they felt so unsafe and we ourselves as adults and parents had to put a brave face on for them and explain that they were safe and explain that sometimes bad things like this happen - not what you want to do when you are on holiday supposed to be relaxing from the routine life!! After much debate one of the managers agreed to provide us with a golf buggy for our remaining days in the park - this took a long time to sort out the next day!We went to Laon to report the incident but the police station was closed, we were directed to another which was also closed, so we decided to return there on our way home to report this crime as we had discovered that it was probably an organised crime that had targeted several bikes that day by people who pay to enter the park with a day pass!! When we returned to the police station en route to Calais we were told (all in French of course) that we could not report it there and we would need to report it in a local police station near Center Parcs. We decided we could not go back to do this as we had a ferry to catch.No compassion, sympathy or accurate advice was provided to us by Center Parcs staff, which has left a nasty taste in our mouths!!On top of this on our last night at 2.30am my husband woke up to find that the house and park was in complete darkness. A power cut maybe? Then aggressive shouts and cries could be heard, along with rustling of leaves and feet on gravel. We had no idea how far away these noises were coming from and what was going on. It lasted for about and hour and was very frightening. Luckily my children did not wake up and hear this. We felt so unsafe we could not wait to leave and get home. We should have asked what had happened before we left but following the lack of engagement and compassion following the theft of our bikes we just wanted to get out of there.

We went for the latter. I took cleaning products with me having read the reviews but need not have bothered. Those reviews which criticise the restaurant staff for speaking their own language in France are, frankly, bewildering to me. Do those reviewers believe the UK Centreparcs staff are multi-lingual?

Looking out onto a sun drenched lake with a lighthouse out there made it look like a scene from a movie.Pool - the splash zone in the pool was amazing, my kids spent hours just in the splash zone alone, with the slides, geysers, and giant bucket that showers you in a tidal wave.They had so many slides to choose from that my eldest 3 children had a varied choice of slide depending on their bravery.My wife and I loved taking my 1year old down the lazy river which was exciting enough for him. Mini-golf - the mini golf had obviously had a lot of money spent on it, each hole was like a scene from \\'20\\'000 leagues under the sea\\', it had nautical technology from the 1800\\'s, it had and unexploded bomb that would start ticking like a time bomb if you hit it with your ball, the kids loved it.The best hole was in a room that had fish on wooden blocks on the wall and a shark\\'s jaw,  the usual decoration you\\'d see , but when your ball goes in the whole, the lights go out and your surrounded by a UV painted room, with all the exhibits leaping out at you (not literally). There was no need to keep score either, the balls are chipped and it is tallied up for you by the customer service desk when you return the ball.Entertainment - they had a PS4 in the bar area and foosball tables which kept my 6 &amp; 9 year olds busy. That\\'s it!The not so good parts:Accommodation - it wasn\\'t terrible, don\\'t get me wrong, but it had a 3 star foreign hotel feel to it, if people are used to the comfort plus villas at Sherwood, then you\\'re gonna be disappointed.The Living room had a sofa that looked (and felt) like it belonged in a student digs. The kitchen had no oven, so if you plan on cooking then bring tins of stuff. It had a hob and a microwave, luckily my boy loves miro fries.It did have a dishwasher which was good, although my 1yr old loved to switch it on every 5 mins, (just to check it was still working I think). The decking led to a smaller lake on our back garden, which was not great looking, more like a bog than anything, so if you request a lake side cottage (which we did) then you may expect a bog side cottage instead. We did see a beaver, no joke, they had real (dam building) baevers.The rooms were very basic, bland d\\u00e9cor, the beds had foam mattresses, and we had to make our own beds. They weren\\'t comfy but I\\'m sure if the weather wasn\\'t so hot I\\'d have been able to sleep on them.The restaurants - the choice of restaurants was poor, they had 4 restaurants and an ice cream place to eat;A Pizza &amp; pasta place, (very nice, but selection was poor, max 8-10 things on the menu)A grill place, (very poor food, selection was poor too, max 5-6 things on menu) A pancake place (didn\\'t go, kids have allergies to eggs, seemed popular though)A buffet place, ( was OK, although my fussy child still struggled with the selection)And an ice cream parlour( kids liked it, but more of a cafe than parlour)The food selection was really poor to our standard, but they did have a great bakery selection in the shop. A massive counter full of cakes, breads, baguettes and sandwiches.Entertainment - they had a kids show on for about 30mins a night, but it was on late and all in French (to be expected in France, not complaining), but my kids didn\\'t enjoy.The bar and bowling areas fail to even meet the standards that we expect from Sherwood. Sherwood has a massive bar area,(multiple bars at Sherwood too) loads of seating, TVs, and soft play area where you can enjoy a meal or a drink and keep an eye on the kids whilst they play.But in france they didn\\'t have this, the bar (only one bar!)  looked more like a school cafeteria, and the kids play area was up stairs, where it was boiling hot, And instead of having a bar up there, we had vending machines with the smallest (most expensive) cups of coffee in Europe.That\\'s it for night life, let me summarise, you can have a beer in the school cafe, whilst your kids run around sweating in the \\'boiler room\\' play area up stairs. The bowling alley was terrible, it was run down, cramped and just really old looking, bits were falling apart, the little desk you type your name in actually came of in my hand to reveal a sharp circuit board underneath.Overall summary - I have mentioned a lot of negative stuff, but we had a really good time, the managers at this centre parcs have spent their money making the pool area brilliant, it far surpasses any of the pools we have been to in any of the centre parcs that we have visited before.In fact it far surpasses any water park or pool we\\'ve been to in a long time.The weather was amazing, and like a true Brit on holiday, I got sun burnt. (Should have used the kids factor 50)As a family we would recommend trying out this place, because it was beautiful. And fulfilled our holiday abroad expectations, whilst keeping the costs down.It took us 2hours 20 mins drive from Calais.

We hired bikes to get around the camp as its so vast but if you find hills a challenge to ride or walk then I\\'d suggest the golf-type buggy, as it can be quite tiring. Exploring the camp on the first day of your visit is a must, check out the activities before you book them as they are quite expensive if more than one of you choose to do them and non-refundable if you wimp out (high adventure particularly). We only discovered the children\\'s playground and other free climbing frames hidden amongst the forest on our last day.Good Points: Location, swimming pool with pool party one evening, range of activities, a few places to eat, local-ish (20 minutes away) supermarket if you want to eat in, spacious cottage, efficient help desk/reception staff. Ample parking, ample bikes to choose from, safe camp (left bags &amp; jackets on back of our bikes and they were still there when we returned), also a forgotten coat in a restaurant was there when we went back too. On-site shops, free little farm, most staff friendly and patient.Bad points:*CLEANLINESS of accommodation, hairs all over our supposedly fresh sheets on arrival, remnants of something on the bedside table and some horrible stains from top to bottom of our radiators in the bathrooms, meaning we would not use it throughout our stay. I took cleaning equipment after reading some previous reviews so I was equipped to clean our bath, sink and shower but shouldn\\'t have to when you go on holiday.Even the public toilets had a rota of cleaning which needed to be signed regularly once cleaned but wasn\\'t completed for our whole 5 day stay, which showed by the lack of cleanliness in them.*COMMUNICATION - even with my GCSE French I struggled quite a bit. We got by in the restaurants and around most activities with my broken French (please don\\'t say I should learn more French when travelling to France for a 5 day trip). But felt really out of my depth when the health and safety talk for the high adventure was done in French to me and my niece. An English speaking member of staff was told to come and speak to us when we arrived but for some reason kept dealing with everyone else and didn\\'t come to us (for 40 minutes). When the original member of staff returned, he was shocked to see us still there, felt sorry for us and took us to one side, but proceeded to explain the safety rules in French and we ended up pointing at the different hooks and modelling what we thought we might have to do. Other holiday makers got stuck on the zip wire but staff were very slow to react, health and safety seems a little non existent at the camp to be fair.Missed Opportunities: *No entertainment of an evening, meaning the pool tables were our only option or bowling if you booked way in advance.*mini-golf and other activities could be extended into the evening.* fast food restaurant was shut of an evening meaning only dearer options were available. Could extend their opening hours.* coach/ bus excursions into other towns would be great as after two days on site we needed to get out.

Availability was generally good (tennis, badminton, table tennis, motor boat, canoe, Aqua Speed, mini golf, paintballing, tree top route, Cool Jump) although the permitted area on the lake was limited so 30 minutes was ample for the canoe or boat. The kids loved cycling round in a safe environment and the view from our cottage across the lake was relaxing.  Our cottage was on the boundary (844) and we were glad that we had a golf buggy. Food was a bit overpriced with slow service but was reasonable quality.The negatives: the holiday went from \\'good\\' to \\'poor\\' on the last full day due to an accident and how Center Parcs handled it. The man behind me on \\'Cool Jump\\' was allowed to jump too early (far too cavalier an approach to safety from the guy running it), catapulting me off the 4m high inflatable and so I landed from v.high up and badly injured my knee. The security guard was called and took a look - his view was \\'ce n\\'est pas grave\\' and that we should go and get some ice from a restaurant (which we kept doing all evening - ice cubes in a J-cloth). That night it ballooned up and I could hardly walk on it (let alone drive to UK). Took golf buggy to info desk to complain about Cool Jump and ask for another night. Manager wouldn\\'t see us (because she didn\\'t speak English, even though I speak French) and the staff tried to be helpful but didn\\'t know what authority they had to remedy the situation. Were from our VIP lake view (844) to a Comfort no view (820) cottage. My wife had to shift all our stuff and we had to vacate 844 before 820 was free. Had to pay 86 Euros for an extra day of golf buggy. 820 had a used nappy and 10cm deep piles of bird poo on the windowsills (swallow nests above the windows). Unlike 844, the bedroom was upstairs, hell for my knee! Back in the UK now and receiving physiotherapy on the knee but nobody from Center Parcs has apologised at any point and the duty manager\\'s refusal to talk to me (even though she walked past several times) was very disappointing.

It was good value for money, and cheaper than a week at a UK park even with the additional travel costs. I read the reviews on this site before travelling so was a little worried. However, I needn\\'t have worried - we had a great experience and a lovely holiday. Positives - ok, so the cottage could have done with a lick of paint but other than that it was perfect. It was cosy, comfortable and had a most beautiful view of the lake. The service was very good, and despite what has been said in earlier reviews we found that all staff spoke good English, we got by with very basic French and lots of smiles :) We tried all restaurants and especially liked the Italian and the grill restaurant. Also had some of the most delicious pizzas at Bar Bowling. The bar staff at Bar Bowling all worked very hard and were exceptionally efficient despite being very busy. The on site shop was handy and the bakery was a delight - I\\'d run round the park every morning and pick up fresh croissants on my return! The swimming pool was good, but best to go in the evenings when it gets a little less busy. Wifi was very efficient if a little expensive. The park was beautiful, and wildlife was abundant. The drive from Calais was straightforward. Negatives - the only thing I didn\\'t like was the number of electric golf carts whizzing around the site. The park really isn\\'t that extensive to justify this. Also, every day seemed to be some kind of changeover day due to flexible bookings, so it meant there seemed to be always cars on site. Oh, and our keys were inactivated before 10am on departure day so we could have locked ourselves out....we didn\\'t, but this should be addressed. All in all it was a great holiday, and I think some of the negative reviews from fellow British guests are a little harsh and unjustified.

To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I was livid at the condition of the lodge and disgusted at how dirty it was. The lodge was filthy - there was dirt and dust in every corner. There was peeling paint on every wall. There were dead flies on the ceilings in the bathrooms. The bathrooms were dirty on arrival. I cleaned the floor in the living room and kitchen and the cloths I used were black, thick with dirt and grime - just what we wanted with two crawling/toddling babies with us!! I also wiped out the wardrobes before putting my clothes in them and again they were thick with dust. Mould was ingrained in the seals of all the windows. The furniture was old and tatty. The fixtures and fittings in the kitchen and bathroom were like being in a time warp they were so out dated. The lodge was also just very damp. See attached photos. General maintenance of the lodge was terrible: - Paint peeling off the walls in numerous places in the lodge - Curtain rail fell off the wall in twin bedroom and whacked my sister on her head leaving a big bump - Loose tile on decking \\u2013 we had to put chair over it to stop walking through it - Broken window in one bathroom so we were unable to close it - Not all of the heaters work - definitely an issue given the rain. Everything inside the lodge was damp \\u2013 including all of our clothes - due to terrible insulation but also lack of ventilation - Extractor fans in the bathroom don\\'t work- The carpets in the bedrooms are so sticky and disgusting, I had to wear shoes in my bedroom. We had two small children of 1 year old with us: - High chair was broken and had to be replaced on arrival. High chairs provided don\\'t have harnesses so toddlers could easily stand up and climb out. - TV in living room was a death trap for toddlers as it was balanced precariously on a small table at perfect height for a toddler to pull down. A flat screen TV should be secured to the wall. We had to construct a make shift guard. - Both cots were broken on arrival. One was incredibly unsafe - it creaked and I literally think it would have collapsed if my toddler had shaken it - No stair gate on bottom of the stairs. The cots were replaced and so was the broken high chair but that\\'s not the point - these things should be checked before being handed out and also it\\'s a hassle you don\\'t need at the start of your holiday e.g. we had already wrestled the cot up the stairs and into the bedroom before realising it was broken and then had to get it back downstairs again, I then had to go to the reception desk to report it to the maintenance team (there aren\\'t phones in the lodges and on arrival we had no idea how to call to get stuff changed), then we had to wait for the new cot etc etc. We then had to do the same with the high chair. Such a pain and a waste of time! I am amazed that Center Parcs allow a lodge to be rented out in this condition. I am sure the response of management will be that the lodges are being refurbished - but that isn\\'t the point; knowing the lodge next door has been painted doesn\\'t make me feel any better!! The fact remains the \\'Premium\\' lodge I booked wasn\\'t fit for use and the fact I paid \\u20ac325/ night is just a joke. From reading the other reviews on Tripadvisor and talking to other guests in the park I know I\\'m not alone. It is disgusting that Center Parcs is ruining people\\u2019s holidays by providing this terrible standard of accommodation. These lodges should not be rented out until they are refurbished and all of the equipment such as cots and high chairs should be checked or replaced before there is an accident. All TVs should also be put on the walls and not left on low tables \\u2013 it is just waiting for a toddler to have a nasty accident. Center Parcs should take action before this happens.

We stayed in a comfort renovated cottage.Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised that it was perfect. It was clean, spacious and well equipped. The only down side is that it was quite hilly so getting back to the cottage (122) from the dome was tiring being 20 weeks pregnant with 2 young children but nevertheless once you were at the dome you spent most the day there anyway so no need to be close to cottage. I would however recommend a lakeview cottage if you want to avoid any hills.The cottage was well equipped, there isn\\'t an oven but didn\\'t really need one. We drove 20 minutes to an Aldi, there is also a larger Carrefour in Laon. Eating at the complex was expensive, ie. buffet 25 euros an adult and 8 euros for children (under 4s free). Looking back it was cheaper to buy an evening meal in advance. The shop on site had lots of home brands however was expensive.We took our own bikes and bought a trail gator to tow my 4 year old\\'s bike which worked really well, our 7 year old managed well on her bike but we had to walk our bikes up a couple of times.There were plenty of activities however the kids clubs and &quot;wannabe&quot; activities were not worth it if you didn\\'t speak French. On other activities the staff done well to explain instructions in English. With the pony ride, parents are to walk the ponies and you must wear trainers. I didn\\'t realise this at first but went to reception and they changed the time so I was able to go back to the cottage and swap my flip flops over!The swimming centre was brilliant and we spent 2-3 hours a day there. Plenty of changing rooms/lockers. Health and safety seemed to be very relaxed ie. you can wait in pool at bottom of flumes, only traffic light system on flumes so often people don\\'t wait for green light and just go one after another as there are no staff at top. What is nice is you are free to take photos of your children having fun in the water so invest in an underwater camera or lots of people were using the waterproof bags for phones etc. There are plenty of life jackets for children to borrow too for the deeper pools. They put brand news ones out whilst we were there.There wasn\\'t a great deal of paid activities for my 4 year old to do, over 8s can do a lot more however she didn\\'t mind as she enjoyed the parks and pools etc. They particularly enjoyed the treetop adventure and trampolines.Fireworks on Saturday night were good, it was a long wait however until 11pm but the children enjoyed playing in the soft play area until late and then there was music playing outside whilst waiting for the fireworks to start.

I was quite excited about the cottage as the photographs on the website, showing pretty, bright, airy, cottages around a beautiful looking lake, had definitely been the deciding factor in us booking this place.  We had paid extra for a premier lake view cottage. We were extremely disappointed.  The back garden, backed on to a lake, but the stinging nettles and untidy plants had grown so high, that from the lounge and outside terrace you can hardly see the lake.  The cottage was dirty.  The wooden floor throughout the ground floor had a film of dirt over it and when the children took their shoes off, they got dirty feet from the floor.  There were no towels at all (which were supposed to be included) so we had to make a trip to reception straight away to get some brought to our cottage (the girl told us we could have them without charge only because she was &quot;feeling nice today&quot; - they were supposed to be included in the price of our holiday anyway!).  There were 3 bedrooms upstairs in the cottage which the children took, and my husband and I took the downstairs bedroom and shower room.  It had a door out to the side of the garden.  There was rubbish on the ground outside the door and the view was of overgrown bushes.  It was a very damp bedroom and even after airing the room, the smell never went away.  Also the bathroom with no window, smelt of damp.  It was dingy and in bad repair and I didn\\'t ever look forward to going in there (and was glad to leave)  The bed was 2 singles pushed together with a sagging double mattress topper put on top.  Uncomfortable.  The plates in the cupboard were still dirty from the previous guests.  The furniture, apart of the sofa and outside furniture, was all old chipped and falling apart. \\'Premier\\' standard is an absolute joke.  It was a dump. Our holiday outside of the cottage was good and we used the pools and the beach.  As a family we enjoyed each other and hired bikes for the whole week.  My 16 year old son is a skateboarder, so he enjoyed the skate park.  Parts of the site were pretty, and we looked enviously as the cottages around the lake that we thought we had booked.  The buffet restaurant was very small and ran out of some foods.  The staff made no apology for any of this.  Generally, the staff were pretty unfriendly.  As a British family we did not feel welcome, even though my husband speaks fluent french, and all 4 of our children (and myself) speak the language well enough to give it a go.  I would hate to go there as a family of Brits who don\\'t speak french.  I dont think that would go down very well with the staff!  Don\\'t expect them to speak any english to you! I filled in a survey when we returned, I also asked Centre Parcs for an email address to make a formal complaint supported by photos, but a week later have not received any acknowledgement or response to my email.

The park itself is beautifully located around a lake and we really enjoyed the peaceful view from our veranda, overlooking the lake trees. Note: it was a 15 minute walk to the center of the park where the pool and restaurants were situated. We loved this as it was a relaxing walk, we had great weather and we had deliberately booked to be further out. Depending on your needs you can rent bikes or an electronic golf-cart to get around the park easier.The park in general is great in the sense that there are plenty of changing tables, microwaves, baby chairs available. Anything you can wish for really, like all Center Parcs it is aimed at families and the staff is clearly used to it as well.There were loads of activities for the different age groups, some required parental supervision/participation whereas others did not. I\\'m not sure how busy it was in general but the park itself never felt crowded and we never had to wait more than a few minutes anywhere, check-in from the car was very convenient.Although we did not have a good experience at the Italian restaurant (waited over an hour for our main course and then the pasta was very overcooked), we had a great time at the Creperie and L\\'Embarcadere where the food and service was good as was the price/quality ratio. We also made use of the breakfast and Delivery service where you get food delivered to your cottage which worked really well and was practical, book the breakfast delivery for your first day if you will have a late arrival! It was a shame that there was no bbq with the cottage, you could buy one in the supermarket on-site but with a VIP cottage I would have expected this to be included. Also, there were no kitchen towels and the towel set consists of 1 big towel and 1 hand towel per person so bring your own towels for the pool!Now the cottage itself, we booked a VIP cottage and I dread to think what a comfort one would be like. The lay-out was perfect, the sauna also, the view amazing. However the entire cottage just felt really worn out and was not clean. The fact that there was birdpoop on the veranda because of two birdnests is absolutely acceptable, the fact that there were spiderwebs everywhere (both inside and outside) was not. The kitchen was not clean, the tap of bathtub in the mastersuite was half detached from the wall, there were no bedsheets for the babybed, etc. There was not one big thing we were not satisfied with, it was all little bits and pieces which added up.All in all we would recommend this park to other families, because we did have a very relaxing stay in a beautiful environment which just needs a bit of an upgrade.", "title": "Amenities and park were great, cottage needs urgent TLC.", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "July 17, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2016"},

In fact, it was half the price to go to Center Parcs in France for five days than it was to go to Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest for three days!!!Naturally, you have to pay separately for any activities you want to take part in at Center Parcs, so I opted for a couple of spa sessions for my wife and daughter, archery, paintball and the adventure course. It was sort of ambiguous as to what was actually included for each activity on the website, but I took a chance and everything was booked correctly, albeit very pricey. Upon arrival we were greeted at the entrance by an attendant who I managed to communicate with in my high-school French; despite getting a lot of British tourists (apparent from abundance of UK reg plates in the car park), much of the staff didn\\'t speak English, but this wasn\\'t a massive issue as I remembered a lot from my younger days. I was given a pack that included a map, key cards, activity tickets and a car park ticket, which I was to display in the car at all times during our stay. I was shown on the map where our cottage was and where the reception could be located.  When arriving to the cottage, it was grubby looking, smelt funny and the mattress, duvet and pillow (you have to put the poor quality bedding on yourself) were grey and flat. My family and I were greeted by a cat that sat on the rear porch, one of many that roam the park. When checking out the bathroom, that too was grubby, the bath was dirty looking and worn and there were no towels; we found out later that we had to pay \\u20ac6 per person to rent a towel pack, consisting of a large and small low quality towel. We turned on the television which defaulted to an app that gives you information about the park, however it was crashing every few seconds and made a right racket!Long story short, the service in the shops and restaurants is something to be desired; the staff seemed apathetic to everything and it was extremely overpriced for the quality of the holiday. The activity time slots are very limited too, so we missed out on two activities that were paid for.

I must say I did not know what to expect given the nature of some of the reviews but we had a really enjoyable week - despite the awful weather.   We paid the extra and got a VIP cottage - it was OK,  not VIP to English standards,  but OK,  although it could have done with some TLC for example a lick of paint,  the decking outside staining etc - but it was generally clean.   But I must say if this was VIP I would hate to see the basic comfort -  so definately pay the extra to get one of these.    Aqua mundo was fantastic - kept the kids entertained in the bad weather,   kids club was great - the guys who worked in this did a super job and my kids loved Orry.   Lots of English onsite in half term week (half the price of Centreparcs in the UK so I can see why).  Agree staff did not speak great English,  but a good chance to practice your french and the staff did generally appreciate people who made the effort. Those  who complain about staff not speaking English - well you are in France and, surprise surprise people actually speak French there .    Only downside from me was that there was a conference on in the week we were there, IKEA I think.  We had 4 very noisy (and drunken) frenchmen in the cottage next to us - who woke us at 4am one morning - would suggest Centreparcs puts all the conference people together to avoid disturbing young families who have busy days so need their sleep.  We ate a couple of times on site - once on the buffet, once in the Italian - I found the Italien better,  they were not overly expensive, typically English prices.  Avoid the Supermarket though - as other people have said use the Carrefour at Laon 15 mins away  - as it is significasntly cheaper (and better).  All in all a great week, despite the weather,  Kids were well satisfied - did not complain about the weather once,  and if you keep the kids happy and occupied it makes for a smoother holiday.

We opted for a 4 person VIP villa (519) which, whilst not having a lake front view (for which you pay a premium), does have a water front veranda on a quite inlet; it did not feel overlooked by other villas and was in a fabulous position for watching and interacting with the abundant wildlife including birds and coypu.  Our initial concerns over safety of a water front veranda, with an almost 4yo, proved unfounded;  it was very spacious (wrapped around two sides of the villa) and very well enclosed allowing kids to play safely as well as see and feed the wildlife.  Outside the front of the villa however required close supervision of small mobile children as the water\\'s edge was potentially very accessible and inviting for an adventurous child! I would suggest a continuation of the veranda railings would improve safety here.In terms of facilities and decor this VIP villa was as expected if a little tired and in need of a lick of paint here and there (in particular veranda railings) and some minor repairs to water damage on kitchen skirting and bath panel and a replacement kitchen cupboard door where the laminate had peeled due to hear from the combi oven.  The sofa had seen better days and the hairdryer in the twin room did not work.  There were plenty of wine glasses but mugs were very small from a British tea drinker\\'s perspective.  On balance however none of these points affected our overall enjoyment of the villa (though they may have, had we paid high season prices).In particular we loved the sauna and the kids really enjoyed the whirlpool bath tub. The open fire created a really cosy atmosphere though the logs on sale on site are overpriced so consider bringing your own.  We found the beds very comfy and there were ample pillows provided contrary to some other reviews I had read.The 500s zone proved to be a great location as a pretty level ride to and from the village centre; other zones were much more hilly and may be less suited to younger bike riders. The standard bikes were perfectly adequate for cycling around the park but we found them less suitable for tackling a circuit of the lake - be warned! There is a fabulous 7km traffic free cycle way accessible directly from the Park entrance and for the more intrepid explorers, armed with a map, it is possible to cycle a beautiful circuit all the way around the lake although note that part of this is on a busy road and much of the off road tracks are better suited to MTBs.  Certainly not recommended for small novice riders but great for teens and adults (strongly suggest going clockwise!)We all loved the pool and there was a great choice of slides (my personal favourite was the disco black hole!).  Felt the outdoor Rapids could have been a bit stronger but great as they were for small children who had the time of their lives! Restaurants were good (we ate out at two) service was friendly and timely and food tasty and reasonably priced. Nice touch that kids under 4 eat free! Staff on site were very helpful and spoke very good English but were also accommodating in allowing us to speck French! Super market was generally well stocked (though limited fresh milk) but a bit pricy as was to be expected.  All in all a fabulous short break easily accessible from the UK in about 2 hours from Calais.  So far my favourite of the European parks we have been to. We will definitely be back and would not hesitate to book the same villa again!

This was a good location for us (single mum, 2 children), as we enjoyed the walk into the main centre and back again in the evening.  The cottage, for the price, was perfectly satisfactory.  Hob, fridge, microwave, dishwasher in the kitchen, all worked fine.  The beds were reasonable, however the pillows left a lot to be desired.  The bathroom was definitely the most tatty area, but as we were in the pool every day, we showered there.  We didn\\'t hire bikes as I didn\\'t see the need to spend the money.  We had bought cupboard foods with us from England and bought fresh foods from a supermarket nearby.  The free toppings available to us were not any good, given the weather that France is currently having!!  I paid 24\\u20ac for a 4 day wifi pass which dipped in and out the whole time we were there.  We did pay to do the high rope adventure which was worth it, but takes much longer than the 45 minutes they suggest.  It took us nearly 2 hours - go to the toilet beforehand!  Other than that we spent all our time in the pool complex.  The children loved it so were happy to spend 5 or so hours in there every day.  There is a lack of restaurants to eat in (only 2 really suitable for family eating - choice wise and cost wise) but several snack places.  We ate at the buffet restaurant every evening as the food varied each night, 20\\u20ac for me and 8,50\\u20ac for each of the children.  However they did want to charge adult price for my 12 year old but I argued the toss and got away with child rate.  Drinks weren\\'t too bad, 2 soft drinks and a glass of red for 10,50\\u20ac.  All in all, for the price it was a good break away in Centre Parcs as there is no way I could afford Centre Parcs in the UK in the school holidays.  The people in the information centre spoke excellent English.

Activities are readily available and plenty to do for a week.This is a really easy drive from Calais We had a vip cottage which is very well equipped . The parc is 8 years old and the constant use is showing on furniture and fixtures . Nothing dangerous or unhygienic , but I can see how it might not meet expectations if you paid lots of euros. There are signs up promising a refurb through to next year.We did not pay a lot. The cost of this holiday was a fraction of elveden, longleat etc. This was May half term , though not at all busy in Europe. Don\\'t worry about the language - this week seemed to be predominantly English clientele and the staff were fine with English .I would not say the staff were particularly enthusiastic  . They did what they needed to, unobtrusively, didn\\'t go much further than that and I would also say they were in short supply...This may have been because there were 900 Ikea staff on site for a convention which closed some facilities and restaurants. This was not explained at time of booking, but the bonus was that the remaining facilities such Aqua Mundo and the activities were readily available.Because of this, I regretted booking the family activity package - best resisting an urge to pre book. Unlike uk Center Parcs booking on arrival is ok, but you will need to line up. The pre poked packages do not guarantee availability and some of the items were not available. If you do not use your package, they will not refund it...We tried the pizza restuarant and it was really slow . The staff we\\'re stressed and unpleasant . This may have been due to the convention, but check to see if people are getting served before sitting down.We also struck out for a day. Went to epernay (1 hour) . The Mercier champagne cellar tour is disnified enough to engage our 5 and 8 year old boys. Also stopped in Reims to look at the cathedral and have pizza.

The sheets provided were paper thin and badly worn so it was lucky that we had taken our own bedding. the mattress in the master bedroom was disgusting and the shower downstairs was too small to use so the 4 of us used the upstairs bathroom which was ok.On our 2nd visit we upgraded to a 2 Bed VIP cottage and this was 100% better. The rooms were a good size and the beds were made up with nice sheets, quilts and pillows. There was an ensuite shower with full body shower in the 2nd twin room and the master had a full bathroom with whirlpool bath (looked a little worse for wear but ok). The bonus was the sauna which was a good size 2-3 person sauna with a large wet room attached. The kitchen was tiny but had pretty much everything you could need. TIP: buy the Nescafe Dolce Gusto pods before you go - they are twice the price in the site supermarket!This cottage was set high in the woods so the location wasn\\'t as nice as the first time.The reason for the low score was because this time we had our bikes stolen from outside of our cottage whilst we were inside having lunch. Considering they were locked which meant the back wheel would not turn, I still cannot figure who would do this or why. When we tried to report it, the lack of English spoken by the staff caused real problems and it was not until the next day that we got new bikes so then it was a struggle to get reimbursed for the day of bike hire we lost. The staff did not seem bothered or apologetic for what had happened and it left us worried about leaving the cottage again or even being inside if someone was so willing to steal when you are inside.On the last night I also had an accident when tidying up the outside garden furniture. I stepped back and some rotten decking gave way under my foot so I got my ankle caught which made me fall over the sun lounger. This left bruising on my arm and ankle but based on the experience of reporting the theft,  we did not bother to report this to anyone. In any event, there should not be rotten decking but based on how dirty the patio was, I guess no one does any maintenance outside the cottage.Center Parcs is great for a quick getaway if you just want to relax, ride bikes and swim but it is expensive", "title": "Bikes stolen, lack of English spoken on site and accident due to rotten decking", "rating": "2", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "May 29, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2016"},

Checking out the map and seeing that this house overlooked what appeared to be a small lake or pond confirmed our choice. Unfortunately the map is very misleading, the pond was in fact a small man-made plastic lined ditch full of green algae and broken beer bottles.Upgrade to a Premium or VIP house and there are lots to choose from that are right on the main lake. Next time we\\'ll pay the extra.We opted for a Comfort which inside was looking dated and tired, with broken and worn furniture, mold growing in the shower rooms and generally grubby. The beds are small and short and the pillows were stained. Bed linen is provided in vacuum packs so you need to make the beds yourself. The exterior of the houses is lovely, each house is different and a refreshing change from the UK\\'s wooden clad breeze block buildings. The resort was quiet despite being at close to capacity with the only queues for guest services which was often overwhelmed. Aqua Mundo (swimming pool) was brilliant, loads of slides, a lazy river, rapids, wave machine and dedicated kids area. The supermarket was also ample with lovely fresh bread and croissants throughout the day. Prices were quite high but we took a lot of items with us and used the supermarket for daily consumables such as milk and bread etc.Not as much choice for restaurants as we are used to in the UK, a fast food outlet, an all-you-can-eat buffet, an Italian, a creperie and another venue which we didn\\'t try (opened too late for the kids). These were all priced OK, \\u20ac20.90 per adult for the all-you-can-eat for example.There are lots of outside play parks and a huge indoor play park too so great if the weather is poor. There is also a small petting zoo too which is free. A large and clean beach on the lake and plenty of nice walks.A nice touch was the golf carts to hire. Too expensive for us (\\u20ac166 for a four seater, \\u20ac231 for a seven seater for a midweek stay) and it was quite annoying after a while as they were constantly speeding along the roads which kind of defeats the enjoyment of the \\'no-car\\' policy.

They quite enjoyed the wannabe sessions (1 hour 45 plus 15min of presentations to parents at the end for the cook and circus experiences) - we really enjoyed the bamboo and Polynesian massages performed by Betty at the Spa- nice fajitas set (food and equipment) ordered and delivered one evening at the cottage, we conveniently only had to leave the equipment outside the door once we were done for Center parcs staff to collect it- staff is generally very friendly and helpful- great range of activities (quad, poney rides, sailing, cycling, segway ...)Points for improvement:- maybe due to the location of the cottage, the feel was more that we were in a pretty leisure village than in a secluded place surrounded by nature. We did have a view on the lake but with a view on the football pitch in between (which also had the benefit to offer plenty of free space for our kids to run around). Most annoyingly we had to endure the noise from the very loud mixing table located outside, feeling we were located near a disco for most of the day and late afternoon. Can be very painful when you come here to relax and get some quiet from city life- apart from the parent and baby class at the aqua Mundo with a lovely coach and free Bledina lunches for babies, there is close to nothing in terms of activities for babies in that village. The closest thing to a baby playground was the giant Lego play area in the children soft play area in the village Center but the floor was quite dirty. No bed sheets provided for the cot in the cottage. - leaflets for food delivery in the cottage not up-to-date in terms of opening times (check the actual times at the back of the map that is provided in the welcome pack)- very difficult to reach the maintenance service by phone (had to ask directly at reception for 2 items that needed changing) although once the reception desk was made aware both issues were swiftly sorted in a couple of hours- This is likely to be a difference between a village in the UK and one in France, but despite our cottage being VIP and staying for a full week, no change in towels or replenishment in toilet paperOverall a very nice experience which is likely to provide our eldest kids with plenty of nice memories. More of a family experience, less nature oriented than the UK one. Depending on what you are looking for, it may not be as relaxing for parents as could be in the UK due to shorter activities for kids, no cr\\u00e8che for babies and difficulty to occupy the baby especially during bad weather due to lack of activities for them. Our VIP cottage was very conveniently close to the village Center with nice interior and exterior decoration.

Opening times are also a bit strange, definitly have a look at all the opening times of the restaurants to plan your activities, you might be stuck in the swimming pool with nothing to drink or eat until 14h.Cottages was very clean, off course, you might have a bug or spider, but it\\'s in the middle of the woods, you can\\'t keep all of them out, in general clean cottage, however, they are all getting very old, kitchen needs replacement. this time we had a VIP cottage, and I would expect a nice flat screen tv, well a 39cm 3:4 (no wide screen) TV doesn\\'t do it for me. this is definitly unworthy of a VIP cottage, time for them the build some EDEN cottage and do a major overhaul of the current ones.", "title": "Center and Aquamundo are very good, cottages are getting a bit old", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "October 4, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " September 2015"},

Very easy to find with very clear signs once getting closer to Parc location.The nearest city to the parc is Laon. It\\'s about 15-20 min away. You can fuel your car next to Laon &amp; you can visit one of many restaurants in the city. If you wish to go to a supermarket, you can find Carrefour supermarket just at the entrance to Laon. It\\'s a huge supermarket with nearly 1/2 the price (on many products) comparing to the prices they have at Le Lac d\\'Ailette Center Parcs supermarket.The check-in was fast &amp; easy as we used the online check-in prior to our arrival. Received our key right at the gate (Electronic key, what a surprise at Center parcs!).We stayed at Zone 0 (zero) which was not that far from the Aqua Mundo, restaurants, supermarket and main Parc facilities. But still, note that the Parc is huge and walking might be difficult for some. From our villa, it took us about 10 minutes to walk to the Aqua Mundo and we were relatively close..The setup of villa\\'s around the premises is beautiful!  2 story colorful villa\\'s all around the parc, what a great view. Our villa was Premium Cottage and included 2 levels. On the first level, we had a double bed bedroom, shower &amp; toilet, living room, kitchen &amp; covered terrace. Second level had 2 additional bedrooms, one with double bed and the other with 2 single beds. We had a bathroom (toilet inside the bathroom) upstairs as well and some closets inside the bedrooms &amp; at the corridor. The villa was very clean. OK, if you really picky, you will find some broken tiles and some worn out  furniture, but this is not a 5 star hotel and you should come with no expectations for a 5 star hotel. It\\'s a great villa in a forest area and it was great for us.Heating system was working great all around the villa and it really made the difference when trying to dry out the towels..Kitchen was well equipped with dishes, silverware, cooking pots, cooking pan\\'s and everything you need to accommodate your party. We had no issues to accommodate 6 people. It\\'s true, there is no oven in the kitchen, but you won\\'t need one either.They do supply 2 kitchen towels, 3 dishwasher tablets, some washing cloth, one garbage bad and that\\'s about it. In the rooms we had our beds made for us which was nice. In the bathrooms you will get one toilet paper roll..So.. to make your life (and stay) easier, make sure to bring with you the following: Few toilet paper rolls is a must, couple rolls of paper towels, extra kitchen towels and extra garbage bags. Very important to bring couple of towels to use on bathrooms floor, as there are no carpets in the bathrooms and it does get wet when you take a shower. If you didn\\'t take the towels package from the parc, make sure to bring 2 sets of towels per person, one for home use and the second for the pool.We brought with us some sugar, salt, coffee in small bags, as you won\\'t find anywhere to buy it in small portions.Sleeping quality wasn\\'t something to write home about.. Mattresses are too soft and defiantly need to be replaced.. Pillows were awful. Bring your own if you can.The Aqua Mundo was superb!!  Just outstanding! Nice sized main wave pool (but not huge), many slides (I counted 8 to 10) and very fun for kids at all ages. Great pool area for the little ones as well. The entire area of the Aqua Mundo is very well kept and it was very clean. You will find lockers at the entrance to pool area. Each locker is for refundable 1\\u20ac (you will get your 1\\u20ac coin once you return your locker key into the locker), so you can use it as many times you want.We took the &quot;family wi-fi&quot; card which gives you 4 days of use, up to 4 different devices. The wi-fi service (by KPN network) was working fine for us, especially at our villa, but it was working fine all around the parc. You will need to register to the network each day, which is kind of annoying, but you need to do what you need to do in order to stay connected.. So take a pic of your wi-fi card to have your password in hand.The activities were nice, but as many wrote before, the activities are pricy. We took the bowling, trampoline, mini quad (for our 6 year old) and the Segway Tour (16\\u20ac PP), which was 30 minute tour around the parc (10-15 minute to get the gear &amp; training &amp; about 15-20 minute ride).Animal farm was disappointing as they hardly have animals there.. When you plan your activities at this parc, take a note that on Fridays &amp; Mondays (check-in &amp; check-out days at this parc) there are almost no paid activities, so plan your activities accordingly and make sure to check activities plan at to information brochure you get upon check-in (or use the app, we did and it was great).We did eat once at the Pizza restaurant at the Dome (Il Giardino) and it wasn\\'t so bad.. Nice sized pizza for 10\\u20ac-15\\u20ac.Other than Laon, we went couple of times to Paris (1 hour 30 minute drive away), Disneyland Paris (1 hour 15 minute drive away using toll highway, 6\\u20ac each way).The staff at Le Lac d\\'Ailette speaks no English at all, so If you are not French, be ready for some language challenges..Overall we had a great stay. This location is our favorite so far, and if we choose to return to Center Parcs again, Le Lac d\\'Ailette will be our first choice.", "title": "Great Center Parcs choice!", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "October 4, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " October 2015"},

It was amazing! We entered our HOUSE (no 484) complete with 2 toilets, large open plan downstairs and 2 bedrooms upstairs and immediately felt at home. Ok there is no oven but as we already knew that from reviews we\\'d prepared for this and there was holes in our bedroom curtains but I can live with that! The pillows were a bit lumpy but we took our own anyway. Everything else was perfect and very clean. The dishwasher was a bonus too. Yes there is some bird poo and cobwebs on the exterior but let\\'s not forget center parcs is based around being in a forest so what do you expect! The staff were lovely, gave us free activities, free wine, free desserts and always happy and helpful. The pool area was clean, there was lots of slides and they were all suitable for all ages. We were allowed to take photos in the pool area although they do have staff going round taking photos which you can purchase. It also says no picnic but I saw many people with their own drinks and no staff complained. The weather was amazing, the whole place was very quiet (maybe that\\'s why it was so good) but I would definitely recommend coming at the end or out of school holidays. We paid less than half the price of the same holiday at UK center parcs inc our fuel, ferry and a gite for the night before! The food and drink on site was expensive so prepare in advance. We cooked breakfast and dinner at home but brought drinks in the bowling bar during happy hour 5pm-8pm and then desserts in the Italian restaurant and had wine there for \\u20ac10 for 1 litre. There is a supermarket in laon called L\\'eclercs where we brought our food and drink and we also brought a couple of disposable bbq\\'s. The activities on site were very good although they do seem very laid back on the health and safety aspect, especially on the zip wire! Indoor mini golf was \\u20ac8.50 for adults and outdoor mini golf was \\u20ac10 euros each for adults but we paid \\u20ac11 for 2 u12\\'s and we just shared their clubs. Free jump was \\u20ac8 for 1 jump or \\u20ac12 for 3 jumps, I\\'d advise doing the 3 jumps and our son was asked back up to do an extra jump for free. Jr quad biking was \\u20ac11 for u12\\'s, adult quad biking was \\u20ac16 for over 12\\'s but they said our 10 year old could do the adults quads if he wanted and they were definitely worth the money. We didn\\'t hire bikes, our house was a 15 minute walk from the complex but we were happy to walk altho next time I\\'ll take our own bikes or hire them so we can do a tour of the whole park. We booked wifi for the 5 days for \\u20ac25 for up to 4 devices and it worked perfect. There is only one English news Channel on the TV so our boys iPads were good for keeping them entertained in the evening. We have visited 3 other center parcs in Europe years ago but this was even better than I remember them.

The accommodation was on two levels, but that did not inconvenienced us, it offered plenty of space for all of us. We always have used the half board method, which was great as when the children were small they were free, which I believe is unique to this site. The restaurants have always really good food on offer, we are aficionados of the Buffet, but beware that when there is a large company seminars they are likely to requisition the whole restaurant and you will have to go elsewhere. The Center is of easy access from Paris and from the UK. As for all Center Parcs unfortunately the activities are pricey but then so enjoyable. I will not say anything about AquaMondo, except that it is a dream for the children.We have always enjoyed a very warm welcome from all staff there and as such we came back to this particular site 3 times.

Took 3 hours from Calais with a stop off. Booked a VIP cottage and the trip was still cheaper than a basic cottage at a UK Parc! It\\'s a really spacious place and a huge beach area next to the lake.

The doors are opened with electronic cards so you can arrive early and then they switch them on at 3 so no need to try and time your arrival. The car park is near the middle so you can stretch your legs etc. The internal lake levels were a bit low but we still saw ducks, swans, a coypu, a pelican, moorhens and lots of birds. There were a few very friendly cats wandering about. Indeed if you\\'re a light sleeper you may want earplugs to avoid being kept awake by the ducks quacking!Has all the usual CP stuff however the Aquamundo is amazing. 10 slides, some that go outside or are dark, outdoor Rapids, a lovely warm outdoor pool. If you like football take a ball with you as there\\'s a pitch and a cool electronic skills game that kept our boys amused for ages.

If you can, book in a family activity pack in advance - you get bowling, crazy golf &amp; badminton or table tennis cheaply. The only thing that let it down was the food. It\\'s all a bit Food Court - quality isn\\'t great. The Grill restaurant is overpriced. If you have garlic bread in the pizza place ask for it without pesto as it\\'s totally drenched in it!

The facilities for younger children were excellent but I felt that grown ups were a bit over looked, compared to English centre parcs. The golf buggys they have are both a godsend and a curse. We hired one and it was fantastic for getting from our villa to the main centre which was 20 minute walk away BUT at the same time there were ones being driven too fast and by children and this made it dangerous if you had your small ones walking or riding in the park. It would perhaps be better if the buggys were a bit more restricted on the roads to prevent this or having roads dedicated to just cycling and walking. The pool area was fantastic although this can become more over crowded due to the visiting coach parties!!The staff were very pleasant and whilst I would not expect them to speak English it made booking such things as activities very difficult.

Stupidly we assumed that the standards would be consistent throughout the Center Parcs brand ..... oh how wrong could we be!I should firstly point out that we stayed in a VIP lakeview cottage, which is their top of range accommodation, described as \\'High End\\', \\'Luxurious\\' with a \\'fully equipped Kitchen\\'. I am trying not to laugh whilst quoting these descriptions!!We arrived in the evening to be met with a pile of dirty laundry at the front door, from the previous guests\\' stay.  On opening the door, the smell of stale cigarette smoke was really quite disgusting, but not as disgusting as the overwhelming smell of urine coming from the toilet in the hallway (which was so bad it filled the cottage if the door was left open).  Already feeling disappointed, we have a little look around hoping that it can\\'t get any worse....oh yes it can! There was a pile of cigarette ends left on the the terrace together with a dirty glass half filled with rain water that had been used as an ashtray.  The cobwebs around the lights in the main bedroom would have made any haunted house experience envious and the cigarette ash on the carpet next to the bed can only leave me thinking that the carpet had not been hoovered in between stays! There were stains on the walls throughout, holes in the sitting room upholstery, the kitchen cupboards were peeling. Also the \\'fully equipped kitchen\\' had no oven, except a combi microwave oven/grill, so the pizzas we had bought the kids on our way as an easy first night meal choice was a waste of money!So with no facilities to cook a pizza we head off to pick up our bikes and have something to eat at one of the restaurants. We take the opportunity at this point to stop off at Reception and put in our first complaint about the cleanliness of our Cottage. The details were noted and we were assured that the cleaning team would be notified - no apology was offered though and they didn\\'t even seem particularly surprised!  After eating we arrive back at our cottage to find everything as it was, no cleaners had been, but by this point it is too late to complain again.In the morning we take another trip to reception, which is also the point to book activities, so we have to queue.  We put in a second complaint, but by the afternoon the only action taken is the removal of the dirty laundry.  We do not want to spend our weekend queueing to complain, so I take matters into my own hands and buy toilet cleaning products and air freshener.Whilst on my hands and knees scrubbing the floor around the toilet with disinfectant wipes it is obvious that the floors of the cottage have not been moped in a very long time - the wipes were black!! At this point I insist that the children wear their flip-flops whilst in the cottage, rather than walking around in bare feet!  I find a hoover in the cupboard so give the bedroom a good hoover to get rid of the cigarette ash. Although this clean temporarily helped the smell of the toilet, the urine was so ingrained in the floor that the disgusting smell just kept coming back.  Had we been in the UK I think we actually would have gone home at this point!Still unable to sit out on the terrace because of the pile of cigarette ends, I complain for a 3rd time on the Sunday, informing reception that I have cleaned the bedroom and toilet myself (although the smell keeps returning), but that in the interests of the next guests they really do need to get the terrace cleaned.  I showed them a photo on my phone just to make sure nothing was being lost in translation!  I was asked if I minded it being left until we checked out the following morning - I explained that at this point I couldn\\'t care less, I was complaining again for the benefit of the next guests and that we would never be returning because the place is filthy!  Again, no apology and no surprise at hearing my comments, just an explanation that 2 cleaning requests had been passed to the cleaning team!What sums the whole experience up was the fact that having taken the children swimming for one last time on the morning of check out, we were joined in our changing room by a Cockroach \\u2026.. nice!!Aside from the cleanliness issue, this Center Parcs is also not a safe environment for children.  We almost seemed to be in the minority when it came to cycling.  When I think of Center Parcs I think of outdoor activities with a safe traffic free environment for kids to cycle everywhere.  This could not be further from the truth at Le Lac d\\u2019Ailette.  So many people continued to use there cars throughout their stay and if it wasn\\u2019t cars we were having to dodge, it was golf carts which where available to hire.

On the site there are lots of amazing activities you can do and there is a lot to do at this holiday park.The cottage that we stayed in was a V.I.P cottage so the beds were already made and it was clean and tidy in the cottage that we stayed in. The beds are really comfortable in the cottage because in some places that you stay in in France the beds are not very comfortable but in this location the beds are really comfortable to sleep in a night.Also you can pay for wi if for a weeks wi if pass so you can check all of your updates on your devices and when you get the wi if you get a card which has the wifi code on and you can use the wif I code for a week when you get it.Another thing is some of the cottages are close to the lake so on night times you could go out on the balcony and see the beautiful sun setting.Also at the centre parcs there is lots to do on site. You can go to the Aqua mondo which is a swimming pool and inside the swimming pool there are lots of different water slides to go on and there is a wild water course which is really fun, there are 4 hot tubs in the swimming pool 2 of the are inside and the other 2 are outside and also in the swimming pool there is a outside swimming pool and there is also a plunge pool which is really cold but it\\'s really refreshing if it\\'s a really hot day in France. Also there is a supermarket on site where you can buy all of your grocery essentials from and in the shop there is a bakery section where you can buy freshly baked things, and there are also 3 restaurants on site where you can eat it.When you go to the center parcs after you have unloaded all of your stuff in to your holiday cottage you will have to park your car in the main car park and when you have parked your car in the main car park to save you time walking back to your holiday cottage you can hire bikes or golf buggies.

We\\u2019ve been going at least once a year for the last 12 years but we also love France, so it was a no brainer in deciding to combine the two. It pains me to say anything negative about France or the French (my grandmother was French) but alas I feel I must give an honest account of our recent holiday there.Directions to center parcs Le Lac D\\u2019ailette from nearby Laon were good. Check in was smooth, we were greeted at the gate by a girl who was polite and spoke good English. She she gave us our lodge number and directions to it. As we drove away I was wondering what her and another girl at the check in gate were laughing about and after now spending a week there at our VIP cottage I now know the conversation must have gone along the lines of this:\\u201cHey Audrey, this family from UK say they love the Center Parcs there and how great it is , I\\u2019ve given them cottage number 747\\u201d With that the pair of them were doubled up laughing. I am also sure I heard Suggs singing \\u201cWelcome to the house of fun\\u201d as we drove past security.Our VIP villa looked promising at first glance. 3 showers, a sauna, 2 toilets and a large decked area overlooking a small lake and we were about a 15 min walk to the centre. However the cleaning of the villa was not great, stained carpets in the bedroom and cobwebs under the bed and balls of dust under the settee. The first morning our pastries delivery did not arrive as promised in our villa package, then we plugged the toaster in and not only did it fail to work it then tripped all the electrics in the cottage. I found the number on a leaflet to ring for technical issues and tried 4 times from 9.30 am onwards to no avail. I quickly figured out what the open fireplace was for - it was to send smoke signals to summon assistance. Luckily my other half managed to sort out the electrics and later on we went to the information desk to request a new toaster.That evening we went to bed only to realise the significance of our lodge number. The spa bath decided to \\u201cauto nettoyage\\u201d at various intervals during the night despite no-one using it at all. The first time it happened I thought a jumbo from nearby Charles De Gaulle had mistaken our porch lights for the runway. Stupidly the next morning I tried the technical helpline number several times but no answer. My other half suggested I try the booking enquiries number and surprise surprise it was the same telephone number. I came to the rapid conclusion that I would have more joy getting hold of Francois Hollande and asking him to deliver our missing pastries than getting hold of someone on that number (I know I am going on a bit about those pastries but I was so looking forward to them!)I trekked up to reception to report this and was promised a \\u201ctechnicien\\u201d would come and take a look but the next night the same thing happened. Again I reported it to a rather bemused looking staff member who told me to just switch it off. I kid you not. At this point I was ready to blow (just like my toaster) but refrained and instead politely ask what number it was on the electrics board so I could do this. I think they employ the FODY method of customer service in this center parcs - try and work out what this is, I\\u2019ll give you a hint, the last 5 words are Off and Do it Yourself.Which brings me to another point. The villa does not come with any instructions for any appliance. It\\u2019s like playing a game of Russian Roulette when you switch something on to see if it does actually work or you break it completely. We tried to use the DVD player but soon found out the TV was HDMI and they supplied only a SCART lead. The same \\u201ctechnicien\\u201d arrived when we reported this, looked and then shrugged saying he didn\\u2019t have a HDMI cable. Luckily the fun didn\\u2019t stop there, in the words of Jimmy Cricket \\u201cand there\\u2019s more...\\u201d . We decided to look into the fact that despite it being 80 odd degrees outside the temp indoors was closer to 200 and found that underfloor heating had been left on in the living area. There there were probably Sheikhs walking around downtown Riyadh that were cooler than we were in that cottage. Again employing the aforementioned FODY method we managed to sort it out.We also decided to sign up to the wi-fi 40 euros for 4 days as we have a teenager who cannot be without Instagram etc for at least 6 hours a day or she turns into Evil Edna. However we couldn\\u2019t connect from the cottage. After sending a few smoke signals to summon help with no response we decided to walk to the centre to report this. They told us to once again use FODY by ringing the people who supply the wi-fi. They quickly checked and told us the modem was broke in the cottage and we needed to get the technician to have a look. By this point I was on first name terms with the technician and was considering asking them to put a bed up in the lounge for him. I saw him more than my own kids on this holiday.The VIP package also includes towels, you get one bath (hand) towel and one hand (face) towel per person. If you are older than 9 then you might struggle for the towel to completely cover you up. I stepped out of the shower the first night only to be disappointed with the size of the towel and it reminded me of that scene from \\u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\\u201d when Steve Martin has to use a face cloth to dry himself because John Candy has used them all. This measly allowance has to last you the full week you are there so make sure you take more (big) towels!We ate at the Italian restaurant a few times and it has to be said that a few of them must have attended the Basil Fawlty charm school. A pause of more than a second whilst ordering for our party of 10 was met with a loud and abrupt \\u2018et\\u2019 - she managed to cut her tip in half that night. They were at times bordering on rude and appeared impatient. To get around this I drank lots of wine to soothe my nerves which by this point were teetering on the brink of collapse. On a positive note the food was ok and the prices were decent - 10 euros for a litre of house wine.Entertainment of a night was distinctly average. There was a quiz in French and English a few nights that included fascinating questions such as this:\\u201cWhat is the length of the largest lake in France. Is it: a.) 18kmb.) 20kmc.) 13kmd.) Don\\u2019t careIt\\u2019s a d every time for me.The karaoke was soulless. The lad doing it had all the charisma of an escargot. Song choices were, well in a word abysmal and included tracks such as Samantha Fox\\u2019s \\u201cTouch Me\\u201d. If anyone has ever picked that I\\u2019ll personally give them 100 Euros. In conclusion I have given it 2 stars one for the Aquamundo (did the Fonz name it this?) which was fantastic and 1 for the beautiful area and cycle rides around Le Lac D\\u2019Ailette. All that was missing from our fun house cottage was a rotating barrel and an array of distorted mirrors. I love a good laugh but this was a bit too much even for me so I\\u2019ll have to say it\\u2019s a no from me if I was asked to return. I hope I\\u2019ve given you all a little taster of our holiday and you can decide from that if it\\u2019s the kind of holiday you too would like to partake in. Me, I think I\\u2019ll be sticking to Whinfell Forest even with the Great British weather....", "title": "Bonjour Technicien", "rating": "2", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 8, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2015"},

Our VIP cottage (519) was 2 bedroomed, had a sauna &amp; whirlpool bath, 2 toilets and 3 showers! The huge veranda which was on two sides of the cottage and had 4 patio doors leading onto it, overlooked the river near to the lake. It was in need of a coat of paint, but it looked like this was an ongoing project as some of the other veranda\\'s looked fine. It didn\\'t really spoil our holiday. there were a few scuffs on walls etc, but not the sort of thing that I would feel the need to photograph and post on here! The cottage was clean when we arrived. Aqua mundo was fab. there were play parks, indoor play area (which my children, age 10 &amp; 6 enjoyed), football pitch, volleyball court and beach. When you book early, you get to choose 3 free activites (ask for the &quot;toppings list&quot; from the booking desk). there were plenty of activites that you could pay for, and we didn\\'t find them to be expensive compared to UK parks. The bike hire was cheap (17 euros for a child bike for a week)we ate in the Italian restaurant &amp; the creperie, which were nice. we didn\\'t fancy the all you can eat buffet, and didn\\'t get round to the steak house but it looked nice. Poolside snacks were reasonable. The onsite supermarket was fine - we didn\\'t feel the need to stock up off site. my negative comment would be regarding the golf buggies that people can hire. It seemed a bit unnecessary, when you can choose a cottage close to the centre or further away (say 20 min walk) if you enjoy a stroll. Considering, we were there from 24th to 31st July, we didn\\'t really have any problems booking activities, or getting a table in a restaurant. the Pool wasn\\'t overcrowded and there weren\\'t long queues for the slides. A bonus to the holiday were the Saturday night fireworks at 11pm.to sum up, this center parcs probably wasn\\'t quite as well maintained as some of the UK parcs, but it cost us approx. \\u00a31250 for a family of 4 for a week. about half the price of staying in a similar UK accommodation. we would have no hesitation in going back to a center parcs in France", "title": "reasonably priced compared to UK center parcs", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 4, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2015"},

We have thoroughly enjoyed these but now that our children are of school age we find the school holiday pricing rather hard to stomach.So we decided to take the plunge and try one of the sites in France. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the price for a week during the school summer holidays is roughly half the UK price for the same week.Le Lac d\\'Ailette Centerparcs is in a fantastic location which is easily accessible with a 3 hour drive from the Eurotunnel.We chose to stay in one of the VIP cottages (number 492) located next to the lake and a short ride from the beach and centre. The cottage was a very spacious and comfortable bungalow. However it is worth noting that the decor is slightly shabby when compared to the equivalent UK accommodation  which has been refurbed in recent years. This however is a minor issue which is more than outweighed by the location and value.The facilities on site are a mixed bag. The subtropical swim areais easily the best of all the Centerparcs we have visited with a large number of water slides and interconnecting Rapids/Rivers.However the restaurants on site are disappointing compared to sites in the UK. Whilst the staff are good, the range of eat out options are limited with only two restaurants open on a regular basis.One other minor gripe is the fact that golf buggies are available to rent. This is an issue when you have young children on bicycles as we do. We usually enjoy the fact that our children can ride freely without the worry of any other vehicles on the road but the golf buggies spoil this luxury somewhat.

And this was really put to the test at this center parcs. We go to center parcs every year in the UK and love it, but we both felt that this place really let them down. On the face of it, it\\'s very pretty indeed, but the cottages need some serious renovation. Not just a lick of paint or an update, but a complete renovation. We had damp... Lots of it. Skirting boards were flaking away like wet cardboard. The fitted baby gate was no longer attached and just fell off (and it was a big heavy one so could not be used in case it fell on the baby!) The kitchen was falling to bits as was all the equipment. Kitchen utensils so bendy I couldn\\'t even stir pasta in water! There was no kettle and a disproportionate number of cutlery... Loads of forks but 3 teaspoons! I know this is probably due to other holiday makers taking the cutlery with them but the management should make an effort to check the cottages between rentals. There is no phone in the cottage so any problem means paying from your mobile or a trek to reception desk. The sofa was covered in cigarette burns. The patio was plastered in bird poo... Did not want to sit outside. The whole cottage was filthy when we arrived... But we soon corrected that ourselves. Positives about the cottage - comfy beds and good shower, but that is where it ends I\\'m afraid. We had read the reviews before going but always take reviews with a pinch of salt. But this place was a serious disappointment. When we arrived we asked if we could upgrade to VIP as we were already in premium, but the receptionist told us that all cottages were in the same state and had not been renovated for 7 years! And it really shows. It feels like they just don\\'t really care about it... Very different to the UK where pride is taken by every single member of staff to keep everything in tip top condition. The village itself... The centre was odd as for the first half of our week it was deadly quiet... Eerily so. Then the weekend arrived and it was absolutely heaving and felt uncomfortably full everywhere. The swimming pool was one of the best I\\'ve been to. 3 slides were shut but there were still loads of slides. My daughter loved it as in the UK they won\\'t let her on most of the slides but there seemed to be few rules here, so she could go on everything.

Our cottage was clean and comfortable,  Don\\'t get me wrong there were a few bits that could have done with a bit of attention (a couple of small holes in the bottom of curtains) and the deck area could have done with a bit of a clean up from the weather wear.  But it had everything we needed.  The beds were really comfortable and the house lovely and warm.  The kitchen was well equipped, with the exception of an oven (we still cant work that one out!)  We hired bikes and I would say these are essential as the parc is fairly large and with young children (ours are 7, 6 and 4) they might get a bit tired walking to and from the aqua mundo.  The aqua mundo is awesome, we swam every day.  Even at it\\'s busiest it was still great, there\\'s a wave pool, a lazy river, loads of flumes, a water play house for the kids and and a very lovely calm pool area for the real littlies.  They have buoyancy vests available for both children and adults and most days there was also a photographer in the pool who took lovely family pictures without pressuring you into buying them.  The changing rooms were clan and the showers warm. The supermarket was well stocked and if so inclined there is also a Carrefour in nearby Laon.  The restaurants are however a big let down, we ate at both the buffet and the italian and wouldn\\'t recommend either.  The service at the italian was painfully slow and the food average for the price.  The buffet we felt was overpriced without a huge range and the quality was again average.Due to the age of our children the activities were slightly limited but we took part in pony riding (adults need to wear closed toe shoes), high ropes (this was awesome!), pedalos and indoor mini golf.  The kids loved all the activities and we would recommend them all.We would also recommend the creperie for lunch or a snack, delicious.Be prepared that the staff overall speak very little English, we tried really hard to communicate as much as we could in French and the harder we tried the more accommodating we found the staff to be.The park itself is very scenic and there is loads of wildlife to spot.

It\\'s half term, so we expected it to be busy.  We stayed in a 4 bedroom premium lakeside lodge.  The lodge was perfect for us, as the four kids had the upstairs to themselves, so we didn\\'t have to look at the mess.The accommodation could be quite lovely with a bit of love and care.  There was a lot of dust and dirt - which is a real shame.  Our fridge didn\\'t shut properly unless you leant on it for a few minutes.  With four teenagers, this was difficult to police, so the contents were not always kept as cold as they should have been.  Indeed there\\'s not an oven, but we had a microwave that had a grill facility.  We used that as storage space for bread and croissants, as if you left them anywhere else (and I mean anywhere) they were engulfed by ants.  We didn\\'t, thankfully, have a wasp or hornets nest on our veranda, but we did have a birds nest that was constructed during our stay.  The visits from the family of ducks and European Water Rats were always lovely.So, we pre-booked and pre-paid for six adult bikes.  We arrived at the cycle park mid-morning to experience carnage like you can\\'t imagine.  There were tens of people wandering around trying to locate a bike - of which there weren\\'t any.  Not one adult bike.  Our four children are teenagers and taller than me - they were so excited at having a bike for the week they were forced to choose a children\\'s bike - which was far too small for each of them, and the brakes were a little iffy to say the least.  We were unable to source an adult sized bike for myself and my partner.  There were also no golf buggies available for at least four days.  My partner and I had to walk the mile or so to the center every day, sometimes three times each way, and were were pretty fed up and tired by day 3.  At this point we had to beg for a golf buggy, which we finally manged to obtain late on Monday.  We didn\\'t want to have to pay such a large amount of money, but having spent 3 days walking we were desperate for any kind of transportation.Activities.  We tried archery first.  We pre-booked 6 places before we arrived, but were only issued 5 tickets, so one of us had to just watch.  There wasn\\'t sufficient safety equipment - no arm guards were given out or finger guards.  I suffered horrendous bruises on my arm.  The instructor spoke very little English, so very little instruction was received for our kids.  The bows and arrows were quite old and worn out.  Overall we had quite a good time though.The swimming pool was excellent.  We enjoyed this activity the most.  Even though the main flumes were closed, the ones that were open, along with the water rapids and lazy river, were fantastic fun.We booked segways.  Again for 6 people.  Upon arrival one of the segways was broken, so again one of us had to miss out.  The session was for 20 minutes briefing + 20 minutes segway experience.  I would guess the briefing took 10 minutes, and only 13 minutes experience (I followed in our golf cart with a go pro recording so know it was only that long).  That was quite disappointing.Three of our children did the high ropes - this was very well organised and would highly recommend it.The on-site supermarket is good, however I took a drive to the local supermarket in Laon where the prices were almost half.Queuing at the information desk is hit and miss.  We spent 40 minutes on one occasion, to sort out the paintballing session (again, pre-booked but tickets were issued for the children\\'s version rather than the adults version so needed to change it).We ate in the pizza pasta restaurant - food was pretty bland and tasteless.  Also ate in L\\'embarcad\\u00e8re - which was excellent.The resort is beautiful.  So pretty compared to the UK box accommodation.

This is our first visit to a Centre Parc so I knew nothing about the set up.  I booked all inclusive and to be honest it\\'s really been a problem since we got here.  We came for three nights - Tues to Fri and check in is 3pm, although you can arrive earlier if you choose we had a long drive and arrived at 3 on the dot.  I found that we had 3 lunch tickets each but only two days (Wed and Thurs) to use them as we have to check out on Friday at 10am.  I asked at the lunch delivery counter if it was possible to use the 3rd voucher on Friday and take the lunch away with us but they said this was not possible as they could not deliver it before we left at 10am.  The young girl was very helpful and took me over to discuss an alternative with the staff on Customer Services.  Another 15 minutes passed while I explained this to her before she went off and got a Manager. After yet another 15 minutes (45 in total) the manger decided there was no easy way around this and said we could use these vouchers in exchange for drinks or dessert (as these are not included in all inclusive). As we just wanted to get on with our break I agreed and asked her to put it in writing incase I wasn\\'t lucky enough to find an English speaking staff member at the restaurant. By the time all of this was sorted, our daughter had had a swim and got ready to go out it was 9pm. There was only one restaurant open so we headed there.  We didn\\'t take any cash with us as we were covered for a drink and a meal but I thought I would present the voucher to staff first.  After yet another 15 minutes of discussing it with a lovely lady in the Pizza Pasta restaurant she called her manager and after trying to convince me to use our toppings for drinks and another 15 minutes passed it was decided that they would not be able to honour what the customer service manager had agreed to, What a waste of my time!!! When I got back to the accommodation I wrote an email to Centre Parcs via Facebook as it was the only contact I could find.  I received a very polite letter back advising that I had written to the UK one and they are a completely separate company to the one in France and advised me to write to centreparcs.com which took me straight back to the one I had written to. I have posted on Twitter asking for a contact email address but am yet to get a reply.  There are telephone numbers to ring but I want to discuss this in writing and there is NO EMAIL address to write to - hence why I have taken to trip advisor.The all inclusive arrangement appears to be somewhat of \\'best kept secret\\' from the staff at the resort. Breakfast can be eaten at L\\'Orree du Bois but after searching we could not find it and were turned away from the Marche du Monde as it was not valid for that restaurant although another 10 minutes queuing at reception the manager advised it was one of the same place and took us to the restaurant again and told the staff our vouchers were valid.There are no clear guidelines on the All Inclusive arrangement.  The tickets says drinks not included but nothing else is specified and the staff don\\'t seem to have ever seen these tickets before.  I certainly won\\'t be booking all in again.  It\\'s all been a bit exhausting and I still haven\\'t got a result.", "title": "On the whole a nice stay but will never go All Inclusive again!", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "May 28, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2015"},

For one if you time it, you can get it inside the school holidays in the UK but outside in France so rather than \\u00a31000s it is hundreds of pounds. Also, being a littl further south, the weather and temperature can be better.Overall, a fab holiday, the weather was 20 degrees plus which makes a big deal. Here are my top tips and comments.:1. You can arrive anytime on the first day but can\\'t go to your house till 3pm so either take a late crossing or have your swim shorts ready to go enjoy till it is.2. Choose your villa using any topping deal. We chose a lakeside house and it is worth it. You get to wake up and eat looking over the lake and it is magical.3. There is a great l\\'eclerc supermarket in Laon about 15 mins from centerparcs so stock up there on food and wine.4. We ate out one night at the pizza restaurant and for five people it was 140 euros which is ok but the ambience is a bit \\'Disney\\' and fake so I\\'d say eat at home and save your money.5. Did the mini golf which was very good.6. Bring your own pillow. Theirs are like a bag of tights. Seriously.7. The villas are great. Yes, they need a lick of paint here and there but it\\'s fine for a holiday rental. 8. Unlike the UK, you can get your car the evening before. Reception said 7pm but security said 8pm. Think it varies but lovely to have it there to pack up in the morning.9. It\\'s 2.5 hours from Calais so easy peasy to get to.

We ate out in the buffet restaurant and found the food to be excellent quality, plenty of it and enough to cater for all ages / tastes. The Crepe restaurant was the same. We liked the accommodation had four bedrooms, two doubles and two twins, over two floors with two bathrooms, which were clean and tidy with comfortable beds and large bedrooms with plenty of storage for clothes. The heating was easy to understand and we were never cold. There is not an oven but we knew this before we went, so were able to arrange meals that we could prepare on the hob or mircrowave. There was plenty of crockery, granted there are no mugs, just teacups, which for the morning coffee  are not big enough, but this was not enough to put us off.  We did have a couple of issues, the first being ants, which once reported to reception was dealt with quickly within the same hour as was the dining chair that was faulty. The service was second to none, the staff nearly all spoke English, which put us all to shame. The childrens activities were good fun and easy to book, as was the archery. We did not need to hire bikes as the villa we booked ( number 950 ) was only 5 mins walk to the pool and shops and 10 mins to the beach, skate park, mini farm and main play park. All in all, great holiday, fab facilities, just what we have come to expect from Centreparcs but not as expensive as the UK.

Ours was surrounded by trees which meant it was permanently in the shade, so we could not sit out and enjoy the late summer sunshine.  In hindsight we should have asked to move to a sunnier spot. Also no kettle in the kitchen so had to brew tea in a saucepan!  We only used the sauna once, probably wouldn\\'t book that again.

After spending a midweek at this Center Parcs location (in October), I can say the following:While this may not feel like a 5-star hotel accommodation, it is definitely a very comfortable arrangement for a family holiday, on a lake, with fantastic facilities available for fun and relaxation. The accommodation was good, comfortable and clean.  It\\'s easy to get everywhere by bike, and despite the rain, there was plenty to do both indoors and out.The main attraction of the place, from the children\\'s point of view, was definitely the Aqua Mundo (large indoor water park).  It has plenty of water rides, and keeps the kids busy for hours at a time.The water is warm, and the adults in our party had a very enjoyable time as well.The restaurants were good, especially the Buffet and the Creperie.  Food isn\\'t cheap, but not terribly expensive either.A few tips:1.  Dress warmly, also in early October.2.  There is a supermarket on location, but if you want to save money, buy your basic essentials in one of the towns nearby.3.  Not sure about the internet connection, so brought our own SIM cards with internet plan.4.  Have 1 Euro coins ready for the lockers at the Aqua Mundo.5.  Bring your own towels for the pool, or pay a bit extra to rent them at the front desk.6.

We will undoubtedly go again. However, we were disappointed with our recent holiday as we felt it failed to live up to the standard that we have come to expect from our Centre Parcs holiday.Firstly, I have to say that the swimming complex was excellent. The sporting facilities were plentiful and to our pleasant surprise were very easily booked, despite being in the height of summer. The setting of the complex is stunning and the views over the lake are quite beautiful.Sadly, however, the accommodation was not up to standard. The house looked very nice from the outside but once inside we found it to be very grubby. Cleaning had been very superficial before we went in. There were thick cobwebs overhanging the pictures. The carpets were very soiled and areas of the house actually smelt bad. It felt damp. The WC and drainage from the kitchen smelt foul at times and persisted, despite the liberal use of bleach which we had to buy and use ourselves before we could even attempt to use the facilities.Despite being able to get a Badminton / Table Tennis court quite easily we were very disappointed with the sports complex. It was dark and untidy. It actually looked as though the courts and tables had been put together as an \\u201cafterthought\\u201d. Most of the time it was unsupervised and there were occasions when this led to some conflict as to who had hired which court/table.I was also perturbed by the lack of hand washing facilities at the \\u201cpetting zoo\\u201d.

The overall look and feel of the site is more attractive than the previous location we visited in  Les Bois Francs last year. However, there were various aspects that we felt let down by. We really enjoy the traffic free cycling, with our kids aged 14, 11 and 6, but the combination of so many golf buggies and a much more lax approach to the number of cars allowed in all the time really put us off. The pool is good, not as big as les BF, and the rapids were nowhere near as good, almost as though the water wasn\\'t running fast enough to push you through the course. Les BF has a really good hot deli counter which we used several times last year, for BBQ ribs, roasted spuds and rotisserie chicken etc - saved cooking faff, cheaper and better than the restaurants. Le lac only had very over-seasoned chicken, or the very pricy \\'deli-very\\' service to the chalet. We tried the former once, didn\\'t bother with the latter. Also, previously we have eaten main course at the chalet,  then pud of ice-cream or creeps at the creperie. At le lac, the creperie closes at 7pm-ish, which was far too early for this to work. These are all small things perhaps, but they left an overall sense that this isn\\'t what we are after. CP in France is cheaper than the uk, which is  a draw for Brits I think.

Our VIP lakeside cottage was well worth the extra money to have a jaw-dropping lakeside view. Our children loved feeding the ducks and the rather intriguing coypus with day old baguette from our decked patio. The paid for activities that were real hits were the tree top high wire and the pony ride. We tried a &quot;wannabe&quot; session which our children tolerated but they didn\\'t rave about it. I\\'m sadly echoing other reviews when I say that the staff are not always up to what is expected from the Center Parcs brand. We were first timers and didn\\'t really understand how the whole voucher/topper system worked and the reception staff seemed quite cross that we didn\\'t... Also, some things that we ordered when we booked the stay via the call centre never showed up, namely a barbeque and a mid stay clean...hey ho, not show stoppers but as we had expected them we were disappointed. When this was raised with the reception staff we got a shoulder shrug and were told &quot;It\\'s not on the system&quot; and blankly stared at, no further help was offered - thanks a lot! Our hired bikes were very tired and rusty and way off the standard expected by my keen cyclist of a husband...when one of the children went out on their bike for the first time the chain fell off. The Aqua Mundo saved the day though, fantastic water park and no interaction with staff required - bonus!

We chose a VIP cottage with lakeside view, pre-paid for bikes and buffet breakfast. Getting to the park was really easy, 2hrs from Calais and signposted once you\\'ve reached Laon. On arrival, we queued for around 10 minutes and the security guard couldn\\'t speak english. We were sent to the information desk to collect our keys, etc.The first thing we noticed when parking up our car was just how busy the car park was. It\\'s a big car park, on a hill and we had to park right at the top.Cottage - We chose cottage number 637 and the location was good for us - far enough away from the main dome that it was quiet, but close enough that it wasn\\'t too long a cycle. The cottage was nice - we had a great view of the lake and overall, it was fairly clean and well maintained. A couple of complaints though - The dishwasher was useless and the whole place felt a little damp. We got a good WiFi signal, but it was *really* expensive. I only managed a 2G phone signal too. Food - The first real experience of the food was the buffet breakfast and it was terrible, considering the price we paid. The coffee tasted cheap and nasty, there were 5 hot items, sausage, scrambled egg, bacon, fried potato and grilled tomato. It was the same 5 items every day and was dripping in oil. There was some cold options too and a lot of bread, but not even closely worth the amount we paid - we were really disappointed. The supermarket had everything that we needed, but was expensive compared to the supermarket, the Bakery had fairly cheap baguettes (1 Euro) and they were nice enough. Most days we ate out (in Laon, etc) or in the cottage. The dinner prices were really expensive for what you got. I noticed in &quot;The Grill&quot; that onion rings with bbq sauce was 7 Euros!!! We ate once at the Buffet, but it was really expensive and when you consider how much people rave about French food, they clearly have never stayed here :).Swimming Pool - The swimming pool was great - lots of good slides, fun outdoor rapids and a wave machine - there is a but and it\\'s a BIG but... It was incredibly busy, all of the time. You couldn\\'t slide down the rapids without hitting someone. It\\'s a shame - I really think a wristband type system could be useful, to minimise this.Surrounding Area - The surrounding area is lovely, we visited Laon and it\\'s medieval city, and Reims and it\\'s cathedral. We also went to a fort around 30 minutes drive away which was pleasant.Everything else - Be warned, don\\'t pre-order the Center Pass resort credit - I was expecting a pre-paid debit type card which we could use wherever - it fact it was printed 5 Euro vouchers and no change was given - I thought this was incredibly cheeky.

We travelled with our children and grandchildren and stayed in 3 cottages in zone 4 (quite a walk to the centre) two cottages had a lovely view over the lake and grass access to the young kids play park, the third on the opposite side of the road looked out of too high grass which completely blocked the view. The lake, beach, aqua mondo are all great, the two biggest let downs are the staff and the cost of extras and when you put the two together you have the worst bits, which is shocking customer service. Staff - generally seemed to actively avoid customer contact and then were uninterested, one exception was the buffet restaurant where they were definitely trying and one chap was really pleasant. Cost of activities was really steep and booking was tricky, no explanation to the topping system for us first timers. Put the two together - we got turned away from the booking desk 3 minutes before it as due to close on the Tuesday (I had thought it was open until 9 not 8), so then couldn\\'t order the takeaway for the group that had stayed in, so I queued at the pizza place to order a takeaway, after 10 mins with only three groups ahead was then told that takeaway was ordered at the bar, waited another 5 minutes for the team leader to finish making coffees and drinks for other team members without being acknowledged by any of them. Then was told the \\'offer\\' that is in the pack can\\'t be ordered there only at the desk (now shut!). Ordered two pizzas (26 euros), then went to the bowling to get a drink and sort out the rest of the groups evening bowling, another 10 minutes being ignored at the bar, eventually ordered a drink (6 to 7 euros a pint), asked about booking bowling and was told it was at the desk, when I reminded them that it was closed, I was told to wait for his colleague who got distracted by serving ice cream, cleaning outside tables, other customers still waiting for bits of their order etc. Eventually got a lane booked but like almost everyone else we saw, we couldn\\'t work out how to enter names on the scoreboard, so lost more time getting someone to come and key it for us. The time ran out before the game was finished, and the time was not paused while the scoreboard was sorted and we came across other people with similar issues. Later in the week had a nightmare trying to book the electric boats and the paddle boards, only open 2 til 6 and only have five boards, and couldn\\'t get three boats at the same time on that day, and basically a take it or leave it attitude at the desk - and we would say don\\'t bother with the electric boats as they are really slow, and expensive. We booked three of the grandchildren on the junior forest adventure, the info desk checked they were all over 1.10m, but when they got there the eldest (13 year old girl) was turned away for being a couple of inches too tall, again with a take it or leave it attitude, so her two brothers went on while she watched, and their Dad was told off for helping the 8 year old whose safety rope got tangled. Properties are a bit uncared for but not really a problem, but was really glad we took our own pillows as those who didn\\'t found them really poor. Cost of food and drink at the shop and bakery was generally two to five times the price of Carrefour at Laon so did three trips there in the week - this really is extortionate profiteering - but be careful if you do as you can\\'t get your car back on expect first and last day so you have to carry it, or if you are lucky borrow a big green barrow thing, which for a 15 person group took two trips from the car park!!

And because of this we did not feel comfortable letting the kids cycle out of immediate view, the freedom of a family bike ride was spoilt. The parc is quite run down lots of visual wear and tear. Our cottage was fine, though very much lacking an oven.

Flew from Newcastle to Charles De Gaulle and a 90 min drive to Lac d\\'Ailette. Had found whole booking process less clear than UK (then again \\u00a3500 cheaper for same in UK). You get &quot;Toppings&quot; that give you free activities and choice of cottage location. We had 602 (premium 3 bed cottage) which was very well located, on banks of lake, entertained by a few duck families, other birds and even a beaver! 5 min walk to main complex but nice and peaceful. Cottage itself was big enough for us, kitchen has hob and microwave, rooms did a job, if you need a couple of pillows then yes you have to be innovative!We arrived at the location at lunchtime, and although you cannot get to your accommodation, you can use facilities, and pool is the star here, a step up from the UK in terms of slides. If you arrive early you can also use this time to book your activities. All activities are booked through reception (or similar desk at activity centre). It was quiet when we booked, as we were early, but later the queues were massive and many things were fully booked the next morning. So my tip, if you are early, is spend some time deciding what you want to do straight away and then take your time deciding at desk (as only there do you know times!!) and book, before the crowds arrive. This is where toppings come in if you have them, they give you free activities, but with many exclusions, tip is to try to use them on priciest options. Staff were helpful in pointing this out.Kids did Accro Speeder (high ropes), Quad Bikes (tame), Pony Club (a stroll on a pony), Aqua Speed (looked like fun). We hired a boat, did archery, played min golf &amp; tenpin. In total came to \\u20ac150. In short, activities are not at full on a UK, but felt cheaper.Eating options a bit limited if buffet is not your thing. Did not try buffet due to picky kids and \\u20ac26 per adult, \\u20ac9 per child) Snack bar in day, Italian and Pancake house open most nights, Grill restaurant open 3 nights a week. We only ate in Grill and it was good if not a little pricey (as you would expect in CP).Very good on site bakers (mandatory to carry a baguette at all times) that opens at 8 for Brekkie. On site super market has most things but a little more expensive due to on site privilege.The medieval town of Leon is about a 15 min drive north (easy to find). It has 2 supermarkets, but, to our surprise, had a magnificently preserved ancient town with a massive cathedral that is well worth a visit  for a couple of hours with plenty of food and drink places to dine if you wish.Just to mention the language thing. I remember a little french GCSE but no more. Some staff have perfect English, some you work though, in one case (quad bikes) the instructor has no English but we got by - its just part of the fun.No wifi and did not look for wired connection - felt quite weird not having connection in 2014 but also added to the relaxation!If you are full on UK centre parkers you may be left wanting a but more. But blessed with warm weather and a great location to chill in, we had a great break. The pool, parks, indoor soft play all provide free options to entertain kids and let one of us chill in peace back at the house looking out on the lake.", "title": "Pleasantly Suprised", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "April 30, 2014", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " April 2014"},

Unlike UK , the villas are brightly coloured units giving a New England look in style .Our villa (440) had a L shaped furnished balcony right on the lake edge with otters , ducks etc .Inside well equipped , two bathrooms jacuzzi bath , separate Sauna room/shower . Nicely furnished  lounge  with comfy sofa and two chairs . Small kitchen , dishwasher , four ring ceramic hob , microwave/grill but no oven ...depends on how much cooking you want to do .take a chopping board with you !Really felt homely and yes a few licks of paint needed , but not an issue for us .Centre is smaller than UK , 3 main restaruants Pizza place , Grill place and Buffet restaurant.A takeaway delivery service is available too . Restaruants are pricey but so are those in Uk Centreparcs , they do also have a burger fast food place during the day and a crepe restaraunt .   A decent sports bar with bowling (albeit a bit pricey on the drinks) . Decent mini market which supplied the basics you need and not really overpriced as some  suggest .Facilities are as UK and Aqua Mondo swimming was very nice my kids liked it , really good for younger ones too. My 10 year old son did Paintball , high wire and loved  it -staff were polite and helpful and mostly spoke good English . Excellent facilities if you have younger kids with large indoor climbing centre( jungle gym) which is free .The weather was excellent which no doubt helped , but what wins this place over the UK  is the beautiful setting , really is stunning and much more &quot;open&quot; feel to UK .We would definitely return  and many Brits there shared the same view  - it\\'s worth the trip over .I would recommend the VIP villa as they are much better equipped .Excellent little village ...

We usually stay at Longleat at this time of year but I can confirm this was cheaper even including Eurotunnel and petrol costs.We had a 4 bedroom chalet which was close to the dome (no. 10 /11)   The layout was somewhat baffling with two separate sets of stairs at opposite ends of the chalet, on one side leading to 2 bedrooms and a bathroom while on the other side they led to one bedroom and a bathroom.  The sofa and armchairs in the living room were unbearably uncomfortable and the only plus point was that they provided constant entertainment to the 3 children in our party, as the cushions spent the majority of the week on the floor. The TV was barely bigger than a laptop.  The kitchenette is small and no oven. There were instructions on how to use everything from microwave to jacuzzi in english.  There are only very small tea/coffee cups, so one of our first expense was purchasing some mugs in the gift shop (at inflated prices of course).  Definitely remember to bring your own pillows!  The carpet in the double bedroom downstairs appeared quite new and clean while the ones upstairs had definitely seen better days.  The towels were threadbare. There is underfloor heating and the small radiators have no problem in topping up the heat. Our first impression was quite disappointing.  But the Aqua Mundo made up for some of it.  So much better and more to do than any other we have been to. We and the children did not get bored all week and there were literally no queues for the slides etc,  although that could have more to do with the time of year ... on changeover Monday we actually found ourselves at one point as the only people in the large wave-pool. it would appear that the no car rule in this Center Parks is not policed whatsoever.  We found ourselves avoiding traffic the whole week we were here and to make matters worse, a few times were actually intimidated by drivers to move out of the way. The golf type buggies are just a nuisance and not necessaryWe took our dog on this trip but were very disappointed that we could not take him into the dome or any of the restaurants.  Usually the continent is so much more animal friendly.  However, he did enjoy running on the beach and the woodland walks.  In the summer this might not be so easy with people sunbathing and using the waterfront more.We did ask  the information desk staff to help us out with making a reservation for his vet visit prior to returning to the UK and although they didn\\'t quite understand why we wanted the appointment, they assisted us no questions asked.  The Vet\\'s practice spoke no english at all but they knew what was legally required and the whole procedure was a breeze. If anybody needs their details, dont hesitate to email me. One afternoon we drove to Leon and would recommend this for a little diversity (and yes, the dog came along and was allowed in a restaurants and cafe no problem)  Before returning to Center parks we shopped at Carrefour for essentials at half the price of the on site supermarket.  Overall we would say this park is a little tired looking and the accommodation could definitely do with updating but we had a good week and enjoyed the experience but will not return.

Having read all the negative reviews we were prepared to not have too high expectations.As it was a very wet week we spent most of it indoors and hence cannot really comment on the outdoor facilities/activities. Also our son is a toddler so most activities he would have been too young for (apart from the pony riding i think) the rest were from about 8 ish. Ill try to be as objective as possible and my experience might be different to others..Accommodation: we stayed in a 2 bed VIP cottage which overlooked part of the lake so me and my son fed the resident ducks and beaver daily. Space wise the UK cottages are definately more spacious. I preferred the UK Woodlands style to these but despite that found the furnishings quite comfy and dozed off on the sofa most nights. The cottage was quite clean and no smell of cigarettes either so could not complain. The added touch was underfloor heating which was very nice as it was a cold week. Kitchinette small and as previously mentioned no oven, I struggled to use the grill setting in the microwave combi and ended up cremating the nuggets. It would have been helpful for there to be instructions. The VIP had a sauna and jacuzzi bath which was nice to have for us adults to relax. Both the rooms had en suites:-master had double bed, the jacuzzi bath and toilet, second bedroom had 2 singles and a shower. There was a wc next to the lounge.The bedding is probably what let this place down the most. The pillows were hollow fibre (bleugh- grab your own pillow if you\\'ve got the space in the car) and the duvet a bit thin (although we were not cold). The towels were rather threadbare imo. The sheets not as luxurius as the UK ones and bed probably not as comfy. Aqua mundo: this is where we spent the most of time during our stay. It had the most slides of all the centreparcs we\\'ve been in, even with 2 closed there were still like 6 or 8 slides. There were hardly any ques too which was likely due it being out of season.The rapids were quite tame  for us at least- and we even took our 3 year old on them- again, and again! The splash zone was great for younger children as you could just lounge and watch the kids being drenched by a giant water bucket or go on the slides. The babies pool had 2 slides as well and a sand pit so perfect for under 3\\'s. It was let down however by the general wear and tear that could be seen all around, there were a lot of leaves and debris from the indoor live plants and I even swam past a cockroach in the pool. The actual pool was not as big as longleats and there was a lazy river, which was very lazy. Around the parc: Inside the main area they had the childrens play area Baluba which was great- like an indoor soft play area with a seperate lego building section and a several coin operated arcade games for the older ones. We didint eat in the restaurants but I really liked the jungle dome interior when passing (much nicer than Elveden).There was a small playground not too far from our cottage and a main play ground which was quite good by the beach. The cottages dont have that secluded woodlands feel you get in the UK parcs and are more terraced style. It was not hilly apart from maybe 2 or 3 inclines and our 3 year old managed most on his bike himself. The area around the lake is quite scenic and there were pedalo and rowing boats for hire. The parc market was very expensive. We bought a whole roast chicken at the carrefour in Laon for about 6euros and it was over 12 in the parc market! We only got some bread there when we ran out. Laon was about 7miles away and we got the fresh groceries there. I found prices in france (for our usual stuff) more expensive and tip would be to buy and bring most of your usuals (cereal etc..) if you can. We brought our own bikes but I think the prices are similar for hire to the UK ones about 23 euro for midweek adult bikes. They only had the one type of bike from what I could see, not like the Uk ones were you have the mountain bikes and city, these were just the city bikes. Golf buggys (which I found annoying as they would wizz past little kids struggling on their bikes) were about 150 euros for midweek I think to hire- they sat 4 plus any kids on your laps i guess. There were a lot of younger people with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths wizzing past on these. It would be one of my criticisms to centre parcs management. I feel they should be hired only to those with difficulty getting around, centreparcs is one of the times when you can enjoy leisurely bike riding without the fear of traffic, and for those with young children a seat or attachment is available. The staff were pleasant enough and even though it was a bit of a stuggle with the language barrier we managed to get most issues accross. The heating was not coming on initially and someone did come out albeit several hours later. They have handy housekeeping points around the cottages. We could not get in on day 1 and walked over to these \\'SOS\\' points. The house keeping staff came and used her card to open which was handy not having to drive all the way back to the reception. So overall the negatives are it could do with better bedding, cleaning of the aqua mundo, less smoking!! boy were there a lot of smokers, even in the playground with children playing and in the house keeping \\'help\\' areas they just chugged- ashtray full of butts! Reducing the traffic in the parc- cars would still be in and out and those annoying buggys and their chavvy drivers!!However it does provide good value for money and despite all of the above I would still recommend and go again in the future.

One day we couldn\\'t order cottage delivery because it was 1.01 pm and the lady started a break, so she just sent us out.I was also sorry for bunnies at animal farm who had very very small cages :(The other thing, that even those inside the park you cannot park, there were a lot cars parked, it seems the rule was not the same for everyone.

He could\\'ve drowned. There were no locks on the doors front or back. He would go from room to room and we didn\\'t get a moment to relax.

The bedroom carpets and walls were stained and the pillows were dreadful.  The patio needed repainting and the outdoor furniture was filthy and looked black even after we cleaned it.

The Aqua Mundo was not too clean and we saw a dead mouse in the outdoor pool, it is obviously difficult to patrol this large area, but nevertheless this is off-putting to say the least!

Had a really great time and already looking in to booking for next summer!We booked a last minute deal on their website and as the prices were reduced, we went for the top of the range VIP cottage on the lakeside. We were really pleased with it, really modern and spacious with a big decking area to the side and rear overlooking the lake. The VIP ones come equipped with all you need such as towels, beds made up, complimentary toiletries, kitchen pack and even a sauna and whirlpool bath! (both bedrooms were ensuite). There are a lot of bushes/trees surrounding the cottages so it felt nice and private and not at all built up. There is a sandy beach with marked out swimming area and my daughter really enjoyed making sandcastles and swimming in the lake. The pool area is huge with outdoor and indoor sections, we went everyday and never got bored - had lots of fun on all the different slides and particularly the rapids one!Activities wise my daughter did the zip wire thing in the trees (there\\'s a small low level course for little ones) and also the bungee trampoline. We did go to the mini disco and children\\'s parade once but it was all in French (all the songs too) so my daughter didn\\'t really join in. There\\'s a few playgrounds dotted around, the best one being behind the beach. Also the indoor soft play area was good. We did a big shop at Carrefour the day we arrived but needn\\'t have bothered really - it\\'s half an hour drive each way and we didn\\'t find the prices really much cheaper than the on site supermarket so next time we wouldn\\'t bother. Only annoying thing was supermarket shut at 8pm which seemed a bit odd to me as people were still arriving (like us - in desparate need of food and drink on the first night we had to pay silly money for a take out pizza and bottle of wine from one of the restaurants as there were no other options). We hired bikes (took my daughters one from home with us), you do need them really to get around as the place is vast! Also we did a really nice scenic bike ride out of the park to the ruins of an Abbey. It\\'s about 4.5km each way (you can pick up a map at the tourist info desk) and my 5 year old managed it fine as its mostly all flat, we took a picnic and had a really enjoyable time. If you\\'re thinking of booking, do it! Would definitely recommend paying extra for the lake view as it was stunning and saw some amazing sunsets.

Let\\'s start with the good. We\\'ve been to Center Parcs at Longleat (UK) many times - at least a dozen - so a lot of our views are in comparison to it. The swimming pool at Lac d\\'Ailette is significantly better, particularly for younger children. There are more slides, more pools, more hot tubs full stop. The rapids are tamer, but better for younger swimmers. There are more things to do for tiny children. The changing rooms are miles better. The continental attitude to health and safety means that if you want to take your kids on a big slide, you do so at your own risk, but you can do it, which is great. The general layout of the site, and the design of the cottages, is excellent. We had a lakefront cottage with a nice verandah, nice view, nice location. The beach area is excellent. Plenty of space, nice clean sand and water. The waterfront area where the various restaurants are located is very nicely designed and generally very pleasant. The indoor soft play is excellent for all ages of children, lots to do, clean and safe. The patisserie is fantastic, lots of delicious breads and pastries. Here\\'s the rub. The bad stuff. Our cottage was dirty. Disgusting carpets upstairs, dirty walls, dirty mattresses. Our verandah had weeks and weeks of bird droppings on it - on the walls, decking, everywhere. The spa bath was generally quite grotty. The towels (extra cost!) were tiny. Pillows were dirty and poor quality, as were duvets. The sofa and chairs were worse than useless - simply sit on one and the cushions slide off the base. Now, granted, I\\'m a big bloke, but the same thing happened for our two year old twins. Outdoor furniture was cheap DIY shed fare, and pretty dirty. The kitchen was reasonably well equipped, and reasonably clean. One of the selling points of Center Parcs is that the site is traffic-free - you can let your kids ride their bikes without worrying too much about them being run over. Not here. For whatever reason, a lot of cars were allowed onto the site every day, and the large number of golf buggies combined with the cars to mean that the whole thing felt anything but car-free. Mini golf for two costs a tidy \\u20ac14. The course is great, very imaginative. But sadly at some point all the balls have been replaced with ones slightly larger than the originals, which don\\'t fit through a lot of the more interesting bits of the course, meaning that several holes simply don\\'t work. Check-in was a quite slick. Lots of staff handing out key cards, not much of a queue at all. This would have been great if the key cards had worked, but sadly not. 20 minutes queueing at &quot;reception&quot; resulted in a shrug and a set of working key cards, but no apology or recognition that first impressions count and that this first impression was rubbish. Of course, we hadn\\'t seen the carpets yet.  The site supermarket was mediocre at best - expensive, nothing special on offer, lack of staff on the checkout. Staff were generally surly. Particularly bad experience was the bike hire staff, who dealt with our issue with nothing less than suspicion, disinterest and rudeness. Aside of a few excellent people, this was pretty much the norm. The site needs better overall maintenance. A lot of the pathways are potholed and rough, a lot of the barriers (logs) between the roads and paths are missing, a lot of the bike parking areas are virtually impassible by bike. On our way home, I received the Center Parcs satisfaction survey email. It asked, amongst other things, whether we had raised any issues when on site. We hadn\\'t, simply because our experience of the staff suggested that it wasn\\'t worth the bother. I genuinely don\\'t think that Center Parcs will take note of this review, or any others - consistent bookings mean that repeat customers aren\\'t terribly important. The things that need fixing aren\\'t complicated - basic cleanliness is the main thing - but this will be costly so I don\\'t think it will happen. So, overall, we had a great holiday. But that was in spite of the poor aspects of Center Parcs. We won\\'t be going back, because the overall quality doesn\\'t justify the premium price.", "title": "A typical tale of good and bad", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 1, 2013", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2013"},

This was our first Centre Parcs abroad having stayed in the UK on a number occasions. We booked here because it was one of the newest CPs in Europe. We upgraded our property and selected a location on the lake which was fantastic location. When you compare the cost with the UK we were looking at \\u00a32500 for the UK and only \\u00a31000 for France which you must keep in mind when comparing with CP in the UK.The property was an end terrace with a balcony onto the water. It was clean but needed a high level clean and a freshen up. The kitchen equipment was limited 4 cups 4 glasses 4 forks etc and the lack of an oven made things a little more difficult when cooking. The beds were ok but we struggled with the pillows take your own if you have problems sleeping. We stayed in zone 5 which was 0.5 mile from the centre. We used our toppings to get bikes - beware 2 toppings for a bike for a week. We thought we would get all 4 bikes for the 4 toppings. Get there early if you want a mountain bike otherwise you will end up with a French special - which were ok.We found the majority of the staff ok - we tried to speak French to everyone and they all made allowances for our poor French. If you want to speak English stay in England.We ate out a couple of times and we thought it was expensive at 70 euros for starters main and a drink each. We went to Laon Supermarket to get most of the food and topped up with the CP on site shop. Fresh bread from the bakery each day which the kids went and got.We had a day out to Laon which was ok loads of cafes and restaurants and very French \\u2013 it\\u2019s only a 1/2 day out though. We went out for a cycle to the ruins of an old church which was about 6 miles away. It was well sign posted and pretty flat - take something to eat if you are making a day of it. There were a number of bird hides along the route.We used the pool every day and I think it is better than any of the UK CPs. There are times when it was very busy but we always got somewhere to sit.We used the sports hall but you don\\'t need to pre-book like you do in the UK - we just turned up and paid.

There were 6 of us in a cottage (three generations) and the centre is very good for keeping families happy.The parc itself is set against the lake which is very picturesque. It had a very relaxed atmosphere helped by the traffic free environment.  I would recommend hiring bikes to get back and forth between the cottage and the main buildings and lake front.  There is a beach area with swimming which the kids loved to play outThe cottage was clean and comfortable (but starting to show it\\'s age), we did have some issues to start with (kettle not working, a light in the bedroom not working) but these were resolved very swiftly (within an hour).The aqua-mondo swimming centre was one of the main reasons we chose this resort and we weren\\'t disappointed.  There are a variety of pools and slides which kept the whole family entertained for the week.  The highlights were the rapids, the lazy river and outdoor pool.  However the pool complex has had heavy use and is showing its age, also some of the areas could have been better cleaned / maintained. e.g. not all jets working in some of the pools, areas of alge/slime, lockers broken etc which took the shine off things.We did a couple of activities during our stay including canoe hire, pedal boat hire and bowling - all were good but quite expensive.  the bowling was very expensive at 30euro for a 1 hour session.Eating wise we BBQ\\'d at our cottage most evenings (we took our own portable BBQ as BBQs are not supplied but can be rented), but we did eat out one night at the italian restauraunt - the food here was OK, quite pricey and slow service (probably why we only ate out once).  The supermarket on site was good stocking essentials (more pricey than an off-site supermarket so worth stocking up in advance if you can), we did buy baguettes and bread every day which was baked on site.Off-site we visited the Champagne region and did a tour at the Mercier champagne house.  This was about 1 hour away and was very good, good value at 11.50euro pp as well.  We also visited the nearby town of Laon which has a beautiful cathedral - worth doing the Petit train tour which starts outside the visitor centre, lasts for 40 mins and is only 5euro for an adult.", "title": "Good stay, nice resort but starting to look tired", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 31, 2013", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2013"},

Le Lac d\\'Ailette was disapointing in terms of how well maintained the park was.  Our premier cottage smelt strongly of ciggarette smoke on arrival.  As I opened the doors to let some fresh air in, I saw ciggarette ends all over the patio area.  There were hairs on the toilets, stained carpets in the bedrooms and stains all over the walls.  I spend the first hour cleaning, and was going to complain to the management staff, if I could find any!!!  Bring some cleaning equipment with you!   Everyone seemed to be on bikes or golf buggies, which is fine except if you decide to walk, you have to have your wits about you, or risk getting run over!!!  The cottage itself looks quite nice but could do with a spruce up, windows cleaned and a lick of paint.  It is very expensive to eat out, but the restarants seem very clean.  The supermarket again is expensive, so bring as much snacks and drinks for little ones.  The cost of activites is pretty much on par with what you would pay in the UK Centreparcs - \\u00a319 for a child to go 45 min High Adventure around trees.  The activity staff seemed very knowledgeable and attentive.  The scenery is breathtaking around Laon, we spent a day off the park exploring the area, which we would recommend highly.  Overall, the bad points were - accomodation was average, the cleanliness was poor, eating out expensive, supermarket expensive.

So were the beds, furniture and the rest inside and out of the cottage. Baluba and aqua-mundo were a great hangout for both kids and parents The only thing that was really a pain in the neck back then was that NOBODY could speak and/or understand English. Well, almost everything in this parc is a pain in the neck now: Baluba has changed into an video arcade room; the master-bed is a ramshackle; the couch and kitchen were decayed. The veranda at the back of the cottage needed some serious repainting. Even aqua-mundo isn\\'t that exciting any more with older kids. Fortunately this time the reception desk was staffed with English and Dutch speaking staff. In the restaurants the staff still ne parle pas Anglais... After staying at (the fairly new) CenterParc Le Trois For\\u00eats in the fall of of 2012, this was really a disappointing stay.

The French invented laissez-faire hence are much more relaxed about our little ones riding the big slides (with a lifevest, under our supervision and with an adult always going first to catch them in the water drop). There\\'s no picnic allowed which is a bit of a pain, on the plus side it does mean the water is clean. Queues were much shorter than in the UK. Remember your 1 Euro coin for the locker. No need to don the speedos as with some other french pools hygiene regulations (seriously, who looks good in speedos).-Accommodation - we had a premium lakeside rental. Really not that much different to the VIP at Elveden in terms of facilities. We brought a DVD player noticing that there wasn\\'t one there. Quiet in the evenings. Inside of cottage was clean and tidy - no issue. It is by the Lake which means the outside areas are generally a bit dirty due to insects, birds. Bring some cleaning stuff if you plan to sit outside. Also suggest bringing a mosquito coil as there were plenty about, although very few bites. There is no a/c in the cottage. View over Lake is beautiful, kids loved feeding the swans and cygnets in the morning. -Bakery next to the shop sells fresh bread and delicious cakes. Nice little trip out for the kids in the morning. Supermarket is well stocked - as is typically in most french supermarkets - remember to bring your own shopping bags. -Little beach was one of the main reasons I booked - you get the fun of sandcastles in the afternoon after the splash of the pool in the morning. Safe, well steeped. -We did Pony Rides and electric boat trip (the pedalos only take 4 people, electric boats 6). Note you need 1 adult per child for the pony ride and 2 adults if the child is 2. Price is very reasonable in comparison to UK. -Great indoor soft play for kids upstairs. Lots of variety and clean. -We took a cycle ride to an Abbey one evening - about 5-6km away and great for an evening outdoor picnic. We took a mini BBQ and the kids loved exploring the ruins. -We hired 2 bikes with carriages for the kids. The bikes are terrible - inflicts medieval grade pain on the legs climbing the shortest of hill. The mrs and I are pretty nifty on 2 wheels and we puffed like hell. No choice but to suck it up - but just be ready. Roads are quite narrow and (quite wrongly in my view) they rent out golf carts which whizz about. I get it if people have limited mobility and need to get around - but most just folk just looked a bit lazy to me. Get out of those carts and get involved with 2 wheels people. -Finally, if like us you usually feed your kids around 5.30/6 then you should know that the earliest you can eat is 6.30pm. No big deal, stuff for kids to do. We ate at home most nights and then at il Giardino for a few nights. Good service, food was fine. Took 2-2.5 hrs from Calais, easy drive. We will return sometime, I\\'m sure.

I\\'m now a center parcs fan. We tried loads of activities - but by far the most popular was the amazing swimming area, which was free. I\\'m not sure what you\\'d call it - it\\'s so much more than a swimming pool - we went there every day - for at least a couple of hours each day - one day we spent about 8 hours there - and yet we still didn\\'t do it all! The kids loved the &quot;water mill&quot; area, then we discovered the flumes, then on about the third day we tried out the rapids, and what a blast they are. Brilliant fun - the whole family was laughing together - it was a wonderful family-based holiday centre.We tried loads of other activities, too. We soon came to see the same members of staff at the different activities on different days, and came to get to know them quite well. They were always really friendly and helpful - and great with the kids. One tip - there are no activies on &quot;changeover&quot; days, i.e., Mondays and Fridays, so you might want to swim on those days. I thought the pool area would be busy on those days, but even in high season at a busy time of day the pool area was so large that it wasn\\'t over-crowded.Before we went, we read reviews that the cottages weren\\'t very clean. Ours was fine. I don\\'t know if they\\'ve improved the cleanliness recently or whether we were lucky. We\\'d taken cleaning materials anyway on the advise of someone on tripadvisor, but didn\\'t need them.We also had a well-equipped kitchen (we had a premium lakehouse - I don\\'t know if that makes a difference). Since there are lots of restaurants on site, we thought we\\'d have only basic cooking facilities to encourage us to eat out, but we had a microwave with grill, a toaster, a hob and a kettle, so were able to cook for ourselves in the cottage and save ourselves a good amount of money there. The restaurants are expensive - apart from the cafe in the pool area - just a shame you have to be changed into your trunks to eat there! But not a problem for us, since we went there every day anyway. The on-site shop is reasonably priced. A baguette for a euro seemed all right for an on-site shop.I\\'d also read reviews that the French staff weren\\'t always that helpful. Well, to that I\\'d say that it depended who you got. Some were absolutely brilliant - they\\'d go out of their way to be helpful.

We booked a comfort cottage at the last minute with 30% discount which cut the cost down as we did not mind which centre parcs we go to. We have visited many Centre Parcs since our younger child was 5 months old. Over the years, we have stayed at both of the Belgium parcs, 5 parcs in Netherland, 2 in France and 1 in Germany. In some instances, multiple times at one centre. As the children grown older, we used the centre parcs as bases to explore local surrounding, we felt the cost is comparable with hiring a cottage and still have the option of using the onsite facility; the swimming area is good for all weather! As we were worried from some reading some previous review about the cleanliness of the cottages, we took cleaning wipes with us just in case. However, the comfort cottage at was very clean and had a dishwasher, a microwave grill which were useful.  The only criticism we have is that this parc\\u2019s rapid and water slides are not quite as exciting as some other parcs so the teenager found it a bit boring. There appears to be no ways of comparing the challenging level of the water slides between one parc to another unless one has visited the parc and experienced the slides. Lac d\\'Ailette parc is perhaps more suitable for younger children. We also found the staff polite and efficient for the few times we booked and enquired about activities and outings. As it is during summer holiday and the parc sells day passes, the swimming centre can be extremely busy during the day! There are some small hills (8%) and some cyclists can be a nuisance to the pedestrians when travelling downhill at huge speed. In the summer, definitely take mosquito repellent as the cottages are near water and in woodland.

We thought it was going to be on the edge of a lake but turned out to be in a wooded area with a stream next to the deck - nice just not what we expected. First impressions are really good but there were a few bits (corners of rooms etc) that hadn\\'t been cleaned, toilet was smelly and the main bathroom wasn\\'t cleaned very well and had no windows so seemed a bit damp - the whirlpool bath was disgusting and we didn\\'t bother using it. There were swatted mosquitos everywhere which whilst maybe unavoidable could have been wiped off before our visit if anyone had bothered to actually clean. I am very fussy so most would probably have been really happy but it seemed to me like they put clean linen and relied on the previous tenants having cleaned!Food and drink are VERY expensive everywhere so be prepared! We got a few basic bits from the supermarket which ended up costing 60\\u20ac! There is very little choice of restaurants and opening times are bonkers the grill restaurant opening at 7pm which is rubbish if you have very young kids.The playground was probably amazing when it was new but it was very tired and neglected - the broken bits of which there were many were are cordoned off which was all a big disappointment with a 4yr old that loves a park!Brush up on your French as there are not many that speak english and they don\\'t like that you can\\'t speak French which is perhaps fair but not helpful! This is a holiday resort after all - surely you have to expect english speaking tourists! Some staff were lovely and some were just plain rude!The aqua mundo was really good, helped by lots of sunshine as most of it is outdoors, loads of outdoor seating, sun beds etc, everything leads nicely into everything else and apart from going upwards to the slides you don\\'t really need to get out the water much to go places. The changing rooms were a bit dark so not sure if they were clean or not but what you\\'d expect for the size of the place. Out little absolutely loved it so can\\'t complain.The petting farm thing was rubbish, tiny and contained a grumpy old donkey and load of scabby chickens, couple of overheating goats and a bit fat rabbit in a tiny cage!The pony ride was good although our leader was at the back picking up pony poo so we had no idea where we were going but got told off in French when we went the wrong way which was a lot!Baluba soft play is really good and big but the electric cars cost 1,50\\u20ac per token and only last a couple of laps so soon gets expensive :-)the beach is great and such a bonus, massive lake which is stunning and offers boats and peddle-boats etcWe hired a golf buggy which was such a blessing in the heat - expensive but when I normally end up carrying an over tired grumpy child so to be able to chuck her on the buggy was amazing - we did more because everything was just a few minutes away!", "title": "some good some bad but very tired and not very VIP!", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "July 17, 2013", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2013"},

We had booked a lake view cottage at the start of February and the lake view was an important part of our decision making process to stay there.  The cottage they tried to give us had 4 bedrooms which we simply did not need. We stood our ground and said we wanted a lake cottage and they eventually gave us one.  When we got to the cottage, which was a premium one, we were disappointed in both it\\'s quality and cleanliness.  The decking overlooking the lake was filthy.  The bed was dreadful and the quality of bed clothing was very poor.  If you are going we suggest you bring your own pillows as theirs are awful. We complained the next morning and they did change the mattress on the bed but simply wiped down the table on the decking and nothing else.  The staff on the reception desk could be unfriendly to the point of rude.  One girl in particular stands out.  In some ways it became a bit of a joke among our family about what kind of mood they would be in.  Having said all that, the facilities are very good and there is lots to do.

I was slightly concerned about previous comments about the state of the cottages but hadn\\'t quite prepared myself enough. We had booked a Premium cottage as those are the ones we have in the UK but there was nothing premium about these. It was so dated and scruffy but worse than that, really dirty. I spent the first 3 hours of my holiday cleaning, washing dishes, hoovering etc as the cleaners hadn\\'t done anything like that. Anyway, we had luckily got a cottage in a good location near the beach and it was fairly quiet. I believe a lot of the others were very noisy, overlooked and far away from the center so study the map before booking. We got some free toppings for booking early (UK take notes) so got a couple of bikes, including child seat, for 5 days for free. We didn\\'t really need them as we were fairly close but they were nice to have and made us extremely lazy. Aside from the horrible cottage (which of course you get used to), the not so helpful staff who tend to prefer the French, which make up about 90% of the guests, the silly drink prices and the fact that a lot of things were closed and not working (in June?!!), there were a lot of good points too. The holiday price compared to the UK was a lot better, the Aqua Mundo was brilliant, loads of slides, the water temperature was lovely and the fact my 3 year old could go down every slide as the lifeguards paid very little if no attention to the free for all that was the pool safety!! The cleanliness in other areas was surprisingly good, the shops were good and not too badly priced, the pony ride was good fun and fairly cheap, the bowling alley was a bit rubbish and the drinks were very expensive but again the setting was beautiful. Just one thing to bear in mind... the reception closes about 7pm and there is absolutely nobody around should you need help. My daughter got a very bad dose of chicken pox and when we went to the center at 7.30 everything was closed, nobody spoke English and there was no phone or information of any kind.

We paid less than \\u00a3700 for 7 nights when the equivalent week at Centre Parcs in Penrith was going to be \\u00a31300 (May half-term).  At less than \\u00a3100 per night for a family of 4 I\\u2019m not sure what more we could have asked for. The staff were very pleasant and helpful and unlike across the majority of France , most of them spoke English.  The place was very Anglo-centric (and busy) for most of the week although things calmed down on the Friday when most of our countrymen headed home and the place was deserted.  Our only real gripe came courtesy of an English family who let their badly behaved, noisy kids spend most of the evenings screeching and yelling at each other, thus ruining any chance of some peace and quiet for the rest of us and making it harder for our kids to get to sleep.  If you were somewhere around no. 325/6/7 during half-term week then get a grip of your kids eh?The accommodation was well maintained and very clean (with the exception of a previous guest having vomitted out of the window onto the canopy over the terrace.  Nice.), yes some of the paint on the walls was marked and no, the interiors weren\\u2019t designed by Tara Bernerd but then we weren\\u2019t paying \\u00a31300.  The lack of oven wasn\\u2019t ideal and made the meal delivery service (most of which were to be reheated or cooked in your accommodation) a little puzzling.  We were waterside and were visited by ducks and ducklings, swans, swallows, a copyu (beaver rat), cats, rabbits and even a water snake which was a little disturbing.  The beds were comfortable and overall we were very pleased with the accommodation, the patio/terrace was fully fenced and therefore safe for our 1 year old.Activities are a little pricey although we moved on to Disneyland afterwards and if we\\u2019d gone there first then maybe that assessment may have been a little different!!  We ate out at Suzette (crepes) which were very good and of similar quality to those we\\u2019ve had in Brittany .  We also made the error of eating out at Marche du Monde (buffet) and to be honest the quality was really poor and very overpriced for what it was.  The supermarket is also expensive (although a baguette is only \\u20ac1 and croissants etc are reasonable) and stocking up at the supermarket in Laon is recommended.The swimming pool was excellent, no speedos required and no attention paid by staff to the signs saying only one person at a time on the slides which meant our 4 year old could come down with me until he felt brave enough to go down on his own.We hired bikes and used our \\u2018toppings\\u2019 (free activity vouchers that you get for booking early enough) which meant that an adult bike, a bike with a trailer and a kids bike cost us only \\u20ac26 for 7 days.  Golf buggies are very popular here so you need to keep your wits about you.Re: wifi, we were told that there was no wifi and that internet access is via a cable which you plug into your laptop and then into a port in your accommodation.We had a great time and would happily visit again, book with confidence!!", "title": "I don\\'t understand all the negativity...", "rating": "5", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "June 11, 2013", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2013"},

Only 3 hours or so from Eurotunnel2. Good value for accommodation in May. Good condition. Clean. Next to a large lake.3. Excellent indoor pool area where you can stay all day.  For those who have not been this is the best bit about centre parc\\'s but there is some variation across their parks.4. A nice site, plenty of wildlife, indoor play areas for kids, petting zoo etc.  In fact it seems ideal for a young family.5. Lots of paid activities - like paint balling (about 15 euro), Segway (about 15 Euro), 1/2 hour tennis (about 9 Euro), Tree top trail (about 20 euro). 6. Rain does not stop play!7. Relatively car free.Distractions 1. Anything you pay for is 50% more than the price in the typical uk - e.g. 1/2 litre of beer = about 4 pound. Buffet Adult meal = 20 pound.2. Peak period accommodation costs can be expensive (typical of all Centre parks)3. You have to walk a-lot or hire a bike (or take one).  You can  however choose which accommodation you want therefore choosing near or far.Overall we have been to 5 different centre parcs across three countries and talking everything into account this is the better one.  I would recommend it and I will return at some point.Finally with a bit of planning you could stop at various tourist spots along the way - we visited the Canadian war cemetery which was very interesting and just 5 minutes off route near LENS.P.S.

Contrary to a lot of reviews on here our cottage was very clean and well maintained.  We stayed for a week over half term in a premium 6 person cottage very close to the aquamundo.  The price (including channel tunnel) was less than half of that for a four day stay in the uk during half term!The cottage was as advertised and had everything needed.  It wasn\\'t luxurious, but was comfortable and clean with plenty of space for 2 children and 2 adults.  My only complaint is that the pillows were very lumpy!In terms of facilities the parc is excellent.  The aquamundo is out of this world with 13 different slides.  The relaxed French attitude to health and safety meant our 4 and 6 year old were able to ride all of them wearing float jackets, even the rapids ride which they adored!  Definitely an improvement on the uk where armbands are strictly not allowed and children cannot access some of the slides.  The water was warm and changing facilities clean.As we booked early we received extra \\'toppings\\' free of charge.  We used these to book an hour of bowling, hire a pedalo and hire a family bike.  These activities were fun and great for free.  Our children took a pony ride and enjoyed the high ropes course.  Whilst fun, I felt that these activities were overpriced (e12 and E10 for 20 mins)Food wise we ate in the buffet twice.  Plentiful choice, nice and hot, good selections for children.  A bit pricey but you expect that in a holiday village and the quality was good.  Only problem we had was that none of the restaurants open until 6.30 which our two found too late after a long, active day.Staff were all extremely helpful and provided you try to speak a little basic French, are happy to help you out with English.  Everyone we spoke to spoke excellent English to us when our French failed!We visited Laon which is a beautiful historical city about 20mins away.  Also has a large Carrefour which we used to stock up on provisions to avoid the overpriced parc market.My only complaint about this centerparcs is that they offer electric golf buggies for rent.  These drive far too fast around the parc roads and mean that young children on bikes/walking must be kept close at all times and you cannot relax and allow them to wander as you can in the uk.

The first time was December 2010 at New Year and we had a really enjoyable stay. The children loved the two storey cottages and said the pool, slides and rapids were better than Elveden and Longleat in England.We returned again at Easter 2013 to celebrate our twin boys 15th birthday, also with our daughter aged 11. We booked in September 2012 so we benefited from early booking discounts and free toppings which could be \\' cashed in \\' for activities once we arrived. We stayed in a premium villa which was nice but not much different from the comfort villa we had previously stayed in ( except for the jacuzzi bath and beds made up on arrival)  The outside space was not particularly well kept and the trees at the back of the villa which bordered our outdoor space needed to be cut back as they were obscuring a lot of natural light which made the villa very dark.The children enjoyed the Accro speeder, like the high ropes but without a harness, just nets underneath to fall into. They also had a great time with the Segway and Pierre who was their instructor was absolutely superb with them, a fantastic teacher.Unfortunately my husband had his swimming locker key cut from his wrist ( at first we thought it had been lost ) We think this may have happened on the rapids.He had money and his phone stolen from his swimming locker. When we reported this, staff told us it had happened to quite a few people on that day. They were helpful in filling out a report and trying to contact our mobile phone provider, but they told us we would have to drive to the police station and report the theft there and they could not guarantee they would be able to speak English. I do speak a little bit of French but did not feel this would be ideal so we did not go. Consequently, although we tried not to let this spoil our holiday, it made us feel very unsafe for the rest of our stay. I was hyper vigilant and did not sleep very well at night after this.My message to anyone holidaying here is please do not leave valuables in your locker .

Whereas we tend to stay at the UK resort we found there were a limited number of activities at Le Lac d\\'Ailette and so used  its convenient location to travel around France.We found travelling by ferry from Dover was the cheapest and felt we were going on holiday rather than just \\'travelling\\'. From there it takes 2-2.5 hours on a toll road that costs approximately \\u20ac16.A lot of the reviews on TripAdvisor refer to the resort being distressed and whilst I would certainly agree with these comments it did not cost as much as Centre Parcs UK and nor did it ruin the holiday. Indeed it is set on a beautiful lake with lots of space and views.We may have travelled out-of-season (Easter half term) but when we arrived only two of the four restaurants were open. Therefore I would recommend you are prepared for your first meal at the accommodation ***but note there is no oven, only a cooker hob and microwave***.All of the food at the restaurants was very average quality and over-priced with the notable exception of the Suzette restaurant which serves delicious sweet and savoury pancakes that are very filling.There is a well stocked bakers and supermarket. However at the time of writing it is very expensive and so we highly recommend taking your own food, drinks and condiments.The activities at the resort are very cheap and good fun. For example kids quad biking is \\u20ac10, Segway driving \\u20ac10, Shetland pony riding \\u20ac15 etc.There are lots of places to travel around the resort:1. Laon is the closest is beautiful with good restaurants. If you have kids a good thing to do is a cable car that goes up and down a steep hill (cost \\u20ac2.50 return each adult).2. Closer by is Soissons but is very average and if it don\\'t enjoy abbeys and cathedrals don\\'t waste your time.3. Reims is fantastic with lots to see and do. Probably one of the best things to do is visit many of the champagne houses. We loved Tattinger which has an English tour costing \\u20ac16 and you get a glass of champagne at the end.4. DO NOT TRY PARIS! It has been described by some on TripAdvisor as a &quot;stones throw away&quot; which is rubbish. We tried going by car, after 2 hours of sitting in typical Parisian traffic, struggling with appalling road signage and unable to find some where to park we turned back!

We\\'ve been to multiple Centerparcs in Belgium and the Netherlands, but Lac D\\'Ailette topped all of them without a doubt!We stayed in a 4 person premium cottage and had chosen for a certain cottage number so we were close to the Aqua Mundo and other facilities. I do advice this because it\\'s a really big park with a lot of hills so it can be quite a hike if you\\'re carrying groceries back to your cottage!The cottage was very spacious for the 2 of us and very clean. Cleaning staff definitely did their job well. The kitchen provided everything you needed for cooking, decent TV in the living room, toilet downstairs and one in the bathroom upstairs, comfy beds and a beautifull outside seating area which we unfortunatly didn\\'t make use off seeing as the weather in October simply didn\\'t allow us to. The bathroom offered a bathtub with jacuzzi and a big double sink. The pool is AMAZING! We spent hours here and we\\'re adults only. I\\'m sure that kids and teens will have a wonderful time and won\\'t be willing to come out of the water. There are 9 slides and different pools to make use of. It\\'s all very new and well maintained, we loved it  in there!We cooked in our cottage a lot so I don\\'t really have an opinion about the restaurants. The only one we made use of was the Mr. Crok snack bar at lunchtime and this suited us fine. Burgers and chips of standard quality, served hot and within reasonable time frame.

Figured it would also be a degree or two warmer. It was.First impressions were not that great. The site has few trees and because it has \\'Canadian architecture\\' - i.e. two storey villas - and not the usual lodges it looks like a holiday village and not a forest retreat. The building itself, although a Premier one, was it need of a bit of a spruce up, too: specifially, a bit of repainting and repairing.That said, the site is also fairly small and pretty compact, which means a bike really isn\\'t necessary for many of the locations. The lake is lovely and the beach nice to walk past on the way to the swimming facilities which are excellent (better than Longleat).Activities are, as in the UK, grossly overpriced but still my children enjoyed pony riding, high wire climbing and quad bikes (and, of course, the pool which is free). Creperie is good but also expensive. On site shop is more reasonably priced. Most of the staff speak very good English although the high wires did require a bit of French and German to understand the safetly instructions. Of course there is no particular reason why the staff should speak English and very good reasons why I should improve my French, it being a French site!Holiday was slightly marred by a trio to casualty when my younger son fell off some monkey bars on to some stones (not the most sensible of surfaces for equipment marked for a younger age group). The staff handled it very well though and the French health system proved to be excellent.All in all, a relaxing trip (hospital notwithstanding).

Even after the fridge had been cleaned several times  (by us and by staff) it still made everything in the fridge smell of fish. We ended up eating out most of the time - at least we tried to. The parc is chronically understaffed. The restaurants had long queues, often over one hour wait. The pizza restaurant only ever laid up half the tables - the manager explained she had too few staff to wait on them so they just ignored half the tables, despite people queuing (often over 50 people waiting outside all the restaurants. All the outlets open ten minutes late, are then short staffed with queues....The prices for activities are staggering ( a family of four playing crazy golf pay over \\u20ac24.)All the facilities, such as the main pool, are smaller than other parcs so the overcrowding is chronic. The parc is in the middle of nowhere with nothing of interest to visit. They sell lots of day tickets so the facilities are invaded by people not staying in the parc. If you leave the parc during the day there is often no space in the car park when you come back and then you have to queue up for ages behind all the day visitors just to get back in. Other people we spoke to described the experience as feeling like sheep being herded into queues just to pay exhorbitant prices for poor services.If you do decide to go bring anti mosquito kit as near the lake you get bitten to death. In other center parcs the villas are offset meaning that you don\\'t hear your neighbours. Here, however, the villas are in terraces (some look very rough like a dodgy social housing estate) and you have to listen to next doors tv as the walls are very thin. In August the parc was not full and we got \\u20ac400 off by booking late and then another large amount back after complaining about the above so it gives you some idea of how well the new owners (Pierre et vacances - a downmarket operator) are running things.

We feared the worst when we first opened the door to our cottage (Number 770) and it was pretty grubby and tired. This seems to be a recurring theme at Center Parcs these days but we\\'d come prepared and a quick bleach up, a good night\\'s sleep to get over the long journey and all seemed better in the morning although the windowless/ventless downstairs toilet always smelt foul. We also picked our bikes up on arrival which was hassle free. We had planned to get a tag along for our 6 year old but they don\\'t do them so she had to jump in at the deep end and cycle everywhere albeit with stabilizers (...turns out that was a stroke of luck as she loved it and could ride her bike without them as soon as we got home!).On the first night we ate at Mr Croks (I think it was called..) and had a pretty overpriced and not very impressive burger and chips. Over the course of the holiday we tried the buffet dinner which was pretty poor and the creperie which was nice but twice the price of the same crepes in the Laon cafes. So I suppose my advice there would be; avoid the restaurants. We bought food at the supermarket and ate at home, same with lunch.Aqua Mundo was brilliant and we spent hours there. All the family loved it. The beach by the lake was nice too.You are in France and, as such, most people speak French! Very puzzled by some of the comments on here listing that as a bad point. Some of the staff speak English, some don\\'t. Try your best and, failing that, find someone who does speak English.The little pond outside the cottage was nice for the kids. They fed the ducks and a small river mammal that sparked much debate. I thought rat, the in laws thought beaver; turns out it was a Coypu (otherwise known as a beaver-rat!...everyones a winner!)A day trip into a lovely medieval city called Laon is worth it. Nice cathedral, train ride and cable car. Lovely cafe there for a tasty Croque Monsieur.

It was located in quite a hilly area.  Some of the cottages were a very long walk so don\\'t choose these unless the whole family are bike riders or you want to hire one of the electric buggies.  Ours was fairly central but even so we had some long walks!There were several highlights - the lovely woodland setting where the cottages were situated and the fabulous swimming pool where we spent many hours.  This was more crowded at the weekend but during the week it was really comfortable with no queues at all, despite being August.  We loved all the slides and particularly the wild water area.  There was a fantastic children\\'s area with various slides and water activities, all undertaken while getting drenched from every direction!  We had read that there was a beach beside the lake and we were really surprised at how good this area was and how much the children loved it!  There was a lovely sandy beach and great swimming in the lake too.The bakery was another highlight - not only delicious French bread and croissants in the morning, but pizzas, quiches, pastries, just right for lunch.  We thought the shop too was very good with a great selection of nearly everything you could need.  There were so many activities on site that in a week we hardly tried any of them.  The swimming pool and beach were such a hit with our family and the weather was so fabulous that we didn\\'t play  the tennis, bowling, mini golf etc that we had booked in advance.  Another time we would book on arrival.The one thing that we felt let Le Lac down was the restaurants.  We tried most of them during our week.  By far the best in our opinion was the pizza and pasta restaurant where we found the food to be fresh and service good.  The buffet was very hit or miss with not a lot of choice and often not enough staff to keep the buffet dishes full and fresh.  The worst was the grill.  The first night we were told we could only have barbecue, even though we were given a menu.  The barbecue consisted of chicken legs and sausages with some not very interesting vegetables.  We decided to give the grill another try on another night but this time the service was really terrible!  Our poor waitress was extremely stressed with too many tables to serve and we waited for what seemed like hours for our food which was not great when it arrived.  We couldn\\'t even get her attention to get some more drinks for the children and were forced to go off and get our own water!  The restaurants were quite expensive for the quality of the food and the indifferent/bad service.  This is such a shame when everything else about the site was first class.In summary, a great family holiday in a lovely scenic setting in woodland beside the lake with numerous activities to suit everyone and just a very easy drive from Calais and not far from Disneyland Paris either.", "title": "Good Family Holiday", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 18, 2012", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2012"},

The location is one of best in Europe , nestling on the side of a lake. We had a Zone 4 3 bed premier by the lake. The accomodation is unique among Center Parcs as it is a two storey house. The bedrooms are basic but reasonable, there is a bathroom, shower room and separate toilet. The bed linnen was of poor quality and ripped. Apart from a large living dining space, there is a large deck overlooking the lake. The quality of features is average for Center Parcs, although certain things are starting to look shabby. There is only 1 small tv in the living room, not good compared to others. The internet , which costs Euro 20 a week is pretty useless , I struggle to read my email! Any thoughts of downloading tv or media, just forget it. The facilities ae pretty good and as per the website. We have 3 children aged 15 to 5 and they find the activities excellent. There are a lot of mosquitos everywhere and in the centre, which is veryh annoying. There is also NO wifi (even Mcdonalds in the UK has it) !!!!!!!!!!!!! Are we living in the 21st Century, sadly not in this part of France.The food is average , there is a Market Buffet Restraunt , the quality of food has gone down from last year.

It is a stunning location and could be exceptional, but for the staff. While there are some exceptional staff here, many are here in body but not in mind. They go through the motions, ignore you and appear to have little interest in customer service. As with most of France, complaining is futile as one is answered with the shoulder shrug.

We had a very good time in Center Parcs, and it catered to our biggest need - a place where people of all ages can enjoy.The good things about the place are the location, the scenery and the facilities. The location could not be better. We traveled to Paris, to nearby cities, to castles and more. Compared to other places we\\'ve been in, the location here was perfect. The views were also magnificent with a stunning lake and marine and lush greenery all around.

A definite recommendation is to rent bikes the moment you arrive \\u2013 it makes travelling around the place faster and much more fun.

Rooms were very basic, with hard beds which are barely clean. The bath tub was smelly and run down. The room had a strong damp smell when we arrived, and spider webs congratulated us from every window opened. Another let down for us which is very specific is the weather \\u2013 it was 34 Celsius when we there, and there is no air conditioning or even fans to help around the house.

Glad we packed  2 obathmats, george foreman grill and dvd  player/ scart connector for extra ease / comfort. Wish we had also packed mosquito plug ins for all rooms. Loved the enclosed terrace - private and great for alfresco dining. The complex- pool was brilliant. Been to lots of center parcs and thought this aqua mundo was great with attentive life guards. Thought the baluba indoor play area, the park and beach were all very good. Monday to friday much quieter than weekend yet never uncomfortably busy. Queue for guest services very long on arrival afternoon. We waited until evening / next day and booked all we wanted easily with no queue. Paintball and electric boat on lake were good. Bakery was used for daily baguettes. Always lots available whenever we went in Thought the shops ok for basics only.Wider area- lots to do. Disney, paris, pierrefonds (merlins castle filming location) etc.. laon was ok however not on the top of our returns list with children / teenagers in tow. Used laon for carrefour supermarket. Had great food all holiday with fantastic meats, pate, cheeses and salads (and very nice wine). There is a macdonalds next to the carrefour. We didnt use  it, however it may be of interest.In summary a good holiday. The weather was kind and we enjoyed some quality family time. It is ideal for families with lots to do. Not a luxurious break compared to a 5 star hotel, however in comparison to a caravan used last year for  a similar price - much more comfortable. It offered value for money and an easy option for a family.", "title": "A week at center parcs", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 28, 2012", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2012"},

Non French speakers should be fine if they are polite and at least try some basic French.-The location remains the best feature. We booked a lakeside cottage and were treated to a free wildlife show every day: Swallows/Water Voles/Swans etc. -The cottages are better designed than most Centerparcs accommodation. Ours was clean on arrival and trivial maintenance issues were dealt with quickly.The not so good-No internet access in the cottage for the whole week (technical problem). This is not acceptable as many people rely on it. There is free WiFi in the dome, but this is not a substitute.-Gents toilets in the Dome out of order for days at a time.-Occasional smell of stale water/toilets in the Dome restaurant area.-The 2 best water slides in the pool were out of use for the entire week, leading to overcrowding of the other slides.-Many broken lockers, doors and lights in the pool changing area. How difficult can it be to swap out halogen bulbs so you don\\'t have to get changed in semi-darkness?-Some restaurants (particularly L\\'Embarcadere) are understaffed leading to lengthy waits), although the staff were trying their best, they are stressed and a meal there became a test of endurance.

Upon arrival I noticed our cottage was charming and well equipped, but obviously not cleaned thoroughly. So I asked for it to be cleaned (again?). And someone did, apparently. Not really a good job though. The refrigerator, for example, still was quite messy and the outdoors furniture was downright dirty. Luckily, it was close to the central building (the Dome, as they call it over there).Nevertheless, a great cottage. And the park itself was outstanding! The aquamundo (which is Centerparcish for the swimming pools) is fantastic! Great fun for children of all ages (and their parents). Many dining facilities on the grounds. Some nice play areas. A small beach aside the lake. Miniature golf, pony rides, archery stand, boating, adventure park, ... Many things to do on the Center Parcs premises.Chamouille and its surroundings are ... well ... extremely boring. If you plan to spend your entire holiday on the Center Parcs grounds, that\\'s fine. Just don\\'t expect many interesting cities nearby. Laon is worth a visit (20 minutes\\' ride, good for about half a day), and Reims, which is a 60 minutes\\' ride, is great for visiting the cathedral and some champagne houses.The restaurants on the premises were fine. One buffet restaurant which was about okay, an Italian that offered nice pizzas, and a grill restaurant which proved to be the better choice. There is also a pancake place, which is fine for pancakes but keep away from the \\'galettes\\', a local specialty. I still don\\'t really buy that people actually like eating \\'galettes campagnardes\\'. Still get cold shivers remembering this. Eating one of those is probably the most exciting thing you can do in this area for miles around. Prices are very reasonable in these restaurants, and children under 4 dine free of charge. The supermarket in the Dome offers a wide range of products. It\\'s probably best to visit a supermarket in Laon if you need to buy in bigtime, because the Center Parcs supermarket is quite expensive (they charge about 25% up to 40% more than in regular supermarkets). The staff (reception desk, restaurants, maintenance) were very nice.In sum: this is a great getaway if you want to spend some relaxing time with your family.

Much to my surprise the chalet was very dirty and shabby. with no facilities like even a DVD player or working dishwasher. not really premium spec at all! there were black and white dog hairs all over the grimy carpets and tiny blood stains on one of the single beds in our neice &amp; nephews room. Should have set the alarm bells ringing! A few drinks and tired kids off to bed and my sister in law goes in to check on her two kids as the room is up an adjacent stairwell to be greeted by them both covered in swarming bed bugs all over their faces and legs, feeding and biting! Both kids and adult traumatised beyond belief and immediately moved kids and all clothing out of the room. killed a few bugs which were full of blood and took photos and videos as they retreated into the wall panelling. A hideous  experience...  spent all night settling kids with the other kids in the other rooms, checking every single nook and cranny for more bugs and one adult slept on the sofa.  Next day we complained very angrily to the reception manager who after a degree of exasperated nonchalance agreed to move us to another chalet.

I was a bit bothered that it had gone down hill since we were there last which was the year it opened, but it hasn\\'t. There was a large group of us, 6 adults, and 7 kids in three houses. The only complaints I would have was that the pool was very busy over the weekend peroid, and I noticed the day we were leaving that 7 bus loads of kids arrived for a day trip which would also have resulted in long ques at the slides, However during the week it was great as there were very small ques. A number of the slides were closed for the first few days and one of the slides on the &quot;Water Factory&quot; never opened we don\\'t know why.The houses we had were in the 700 area and all of them although not on the lake had water behind them which meant that the deck at the back of the house had a railing around it which is not what we wanted. If I was going again I would look for houses in the 100-200 numbers as this side of the park had alot more space around the houses. We stayed in a comfort house for one week and in a preimum house for the next 5 days (as this was all that was available) and I would have to say I couuld see no difference, there is a dishwasher in both houses and the kitchen furniture was proably a bit better but that was it, I certainly wouldn\\'t opt for it again.We ate in the itialian resturant twice during our stay and the food was excellent but it was too expencive to be eating out every night, anyway we prefer to cook a dinner in the house for the kids. we did most of our shopping in the supermarket before arriving.

We need not have been so.Cottage was clean enough- not spotless took some flash wipes for finishing touches. I turned on the Jacuzzi \\u2013 only to have a poor smell and there is no way I would have used it or let the kids. The downstairs loo had a smell of stagnant water every day \\u2013 I\\u2019m not sure if these are built in porter loos. We had a nice view and the above points didn\\u2019t spoil our initial opinion.Location: We were in Zone 5 \\u2013 for us this was the best area as it\\u2019s close to beach, Skate Park and football pitch. The best location if you want to let your kids run free and you can keep an eye on them. The villas from 537  - which is a 4 bed VIP but there are 6 8 and 4 bed premiers there also-  have a view of the lake and the football pitch etc.  For me there is not much difference between a Premier and VIP.The whole place did not feel busy by any means. People kept themselves to themselves; there were some English there also.Food:  Now maybe we got a good a week, but we ate in the pancake restaurant every day after swimming and it was really good.We had the raclette service \\u2013 a bit of advice \\u2013 we ordered for three adults and two children \\u2013 there was too much food. I would order half of what you think. you need  - two adults only would have been enough. We threw loads of ham etc away. Cost 59 euroWe ordered the take home chicken one day \\u2013 enough for 5 and loads of roast potatoes- this was also good. Costs 14.90 euro.We ate dinner in the Marche du Monde Buffet- I wish we had done this from the start \\u2013 food was good \\u2013 the kids can go off and play- cost per adult 19.10 \\u2013 all you can eat and for an extra 4.10 euro p/p wine and beer and soft drinks inclusive all night!! Considering a beer is approx 4.00 a really good deal.Pool- good quiet- not big queues when we were there. Enough slides.Bikes \\u2013 this was great- you just go and get one- no queues nothing like the English need for organisation- but it worked and I think less queues because of their relaxed system.Supermarket \\u2013 We didn\\u2019t have enough room in the car for more shopping, but if you can stop off at the super market outside the village I would if you intend to eat in. But it\\u2019s stocked enough for a basic meal. Nuggets etc \\u2013 but we didn\\u2019t do this.The bakery is good \\u2013 we didn\\u2019t use the delivery service, as we liked the cycle in the morning.The public toilets \\u2013men\\u2019s mainly- were dirty one day \\u2013 someone had decided to let go all over the floor by all accounts!  But this could happen anywhere. One day flooded so don\\u2019t use the loos inside the Aqua Mundo- but those in the changing room close by. Changing rooms tidy. To be fair any problems like the above were sorted out quickly.Staff-  some staff spoke better English than others- better than my French \\u2013 one girl Stephanie was a bit annoying- my husband who is OK at French tried to order in French but she kept saying she didn\\u2019t understand. All the other staff were really polite and helpful. Didn\\u2019t feel the need to try to speak French but I like to practice once or twice a year and so we shared a few giggles with the staff.I hope that this review is factual enough to dispel any fears \\u2013 like those I had before we went. Despite some minor negatives- were going to stay on for two more days- but my teenager had had enough by this time.This Center Parcs does not feel like a UK Center Parcs- so the kids felt they were getting a different holiday. Its not as commercial and more simplistic but well organised for activities, which you don\\u2019t have to book in advance of travel. We did book the family bowling and racket package in advance however but the time slots you book when there, we almost always got the times we wanted.

We arrived at 3pm checkin time and were dealt with efficiently (although we did speak French) - we didn\\'t even have to leave the car. You can drive to your chalet to drop off bags, then put the car in the main car park at the entry for the rest of your stay.We were lucky to get a lovely cottage only 5 mins walk from the centre of the park (where the pool, restaurants, shop, playground, beach area, etc are). Depending on where you are though, you could be about 20-30mins walk away. You can rent bikes (with kids or infant seats, or kid\\'s trailer) for a reasonable price (cheaper and quicker if prebooked online), or an electric buggy! If you plan to mainly stay in your cottage you won\\'t need to, but if you make frequent trips back to the main area it could get tiresome without transport.You could easily spend a week here - the shop has everything (prices a bit higher than hypermarkets but not bad), there are 3 or 4 restaurants/cafes, and there are plenty of activities to do - see the website. The beach area is lovely but small enough and you can walk along the lakeside for a while. There\\'s also a small hiking area.For kids, the place is very good. It has the best waterpark I\\'ve ever seen - I\\'m not sure why people have not talked about it more. It is massive! It\\'s also covered by a giant plastic dome so even on rainy days you are fine. There is also an outdoor bit. The waterslides are the main attraction and are fantastic. There\\'s a toddler pool, kids pool with small slides, and then a large main pool. This last one is a bit dangerous though as there is a current, so smaller kids will get swept out and it\\'s not that well marked. The flow leads to the outdoor bit which is fine but it\\'s strong. Some of the slides are really amazing, and there are also jacuzzis and deckchairs. You can easily spend hours here - your kids will love it.There is also a kids club which was fine for 2 hours; 3 playgrounds (2 small and 1 absolutely massive one), and you can go zorbing on the beach or rent pedalboats, amongst other things. There\\'s a small farm which the kids appreciated, and you can ponyride.We ate in the crepe cafe which was nice but a bit pricy. The main restaurant has a buffet system and another an a la carte menu. There\\'s a burger place too (with bouncy castle!). The bakery is lovely and we arranged morning delivery to our door - fantastic. We brought loads of food so didn\\'t need to eat out. The cottages have small kitchens but there\\'s a hob, microwave and big fridge/freezer. Pots and pans, cutlery etc is all there. You need to rent teatowels or bring your own. Same for bathroom towels. The houses are not cleaned during your stay unless you pay for it. You are also asked to clean the house before you leave, and take out bins and leave bedsheets outside - a pity considering the place is not really cheap. We got a cottage with our own sauna which was fantastic. They also have jacuzzi baths. There is internet access but it is expensive.My only real reservation is that you can get tired of being here after 3-4 days and you might consider a day trip. There are tours offered that you can join, or you can just hit the road yourself. The surrounding area has lots of World War memorials but not much else other than farmland. Laon (15 mins) has a hypermarket and a nice cathedral.Actually there is one important thing that the park really has to address - road safety. The roads are very narrow and one-way, although bikes ignore this. But you share the road with walkers, cyclists, electric buggies and fairly frequently cars. We once had to dive off the road as someone drove at us at 60kph. A 6 year old in an electric buggy almost ran us over too. On the bike with the kids on the back we were overtaken at close range by crazy teenage cyclists. It\\'s just not that safe. They say that cars are not allowed at the cottages, but some people are clearly driving around all the time.Overall it\\'s a great place for a week with a family.

Then refused to open the gate to enable me to drive to my chalet - another traipse back up the hill to tell them this.Finally I managed to get to the chalet which looked a little tired and I was disappointed - it clearly hadn\\'t been cleaned very well since the last guests had left. The bathroom was dirty - toilet hadn\\'t even been flushed, hair was left around the bath, the tap was hanging off the wall, the floor, well, I made the mistake of taking my shoes off and my feet were covered in muck.I thought things would get better, but sadly they didn\\'t. Throughout the first week the chalet was hardly cleaned, towels were taken and never replaced (I had to go and find my own), someone took the bike out the front of my chalet and never returned it.When I returned for the second time - in another chalet it was more of the same. This time I arrived and the bed hadn\\'t even been made up - the sheets were sitting on it in the plastic wrapping - no towels has been provided - again a dirty bathroom, and worst of all, I found someone else\\'s pants still in the bathroom.

{"reviewer_id": "64BCE8B2ED5885A2A0DD5A9763F52A9E", "review_language": "en", "review_id": "115259953", "pid": "38673", "locid": "775381", "review": "We stayed here for a week in July as a large extended family group of 10 adults and 10 kids in a number of &quot;Premium&quot; cottages. We had a great week and would highly recommend the park, particularly for families with older kids and teens as there is just tonnes to do.I had been a bit worried having read some of the previous reviews but they didn\\'t reflect our experience at all. Here\\'s our thoughts on the key bits:Cottages - were perfectly clean on arrival and very comfortable. The bedrooms are a great size and the layout and style of the houses seems to help keep them cool without aircon. A few minor negatives - the equipment didn\\'t seem to be the same in each house (1 had no toaster, 1 had no coffee machine &amp; 1 had no kettle) but anything missing was replaced as soon as we contacted reception. Despite me emailing before arrival to confirm the number of towel packs required in each house we were short at least one in every house, but these were replaced within 10 mins of us notifying reception. A few of the cottages backed on to what were described as small lakes but essentially were pools of stagnant water, these weren\\'t the most pleasant to sit next to and attracted a lot of insects so we didn\\'t sit out the back much at all. These were fairly minor and the standard of accommodation compared to say caravan parks, which are similar prices, is vastly superior. A real positive as a large group was that we were on a quiet cross-street which, given the no cars policy, meant we were able to pull together tables and chairs and eat as a large group of 20 &quot;street party&quot; style, it worked great for the adults as we could let the kids play around us without worrying. This was one of the main advantages of having all the cottages in the same street, the kids were able to roam as they pleased. I would agree partially with one of the other reviewers though, the main roads weren\\'t as safe as they should be given the no cars policy (which doesn\\'t apply on the changeover days Monday &amp; Friday, nor on the evenings before changeover day after 7pm) as the Centerparcs cleaning and security staff and the takeaway delivery staff all have vans which they do drive quite fast around the site. The golf buggies (often driven by 15 year olds!) are also far too fast, some speed bumps would definitely help. On the whole though the cross-streets and side streets were very quiet and very safe.Pool complex - brilliant for the kids, they just loved it, it seemed very clean when we were there, in fact one of the main things we noticed was that there permanently seemed to be at least 2 cleaners around the changing rooms and leading out to the pool, working very hard.The only real downside I can see to the Aqua Mundo is that you can\\'t just wander up and sit down for a while watching the rest of your family in the pool or take a small baby in a buggy up to sit, its very much like going into a leisure centre with changing cubicles and lockers before you enter. There are plenty of chairs around the pool but it wouldn\\'t be somewhere I would sit for any length of time. The kids adored all the slides, the lazy river, the toddler pool, the rain playzone, it was great.Also great was Baluba the indoor play area, very quite most evenings and always very clean. Plenty of slides, climbing frames and soft play equipment for all ages. The only real downside is the inevitable number of machines which you feed Euro tokens in to get some rubbish worth 20p BUT the kids are addicted to them!! Bike rental was great and we all enjoyed it, I haven\\'t been on a bike in years but it is needed otherwise every trip to the pool, beach or restaurants would be a long hike. Think of getting one of the bikes with KiddieCart trailer if you\\'ve small kids as they are great for bringing back shopping from the (reasonably stocked) supermarket onsite. The beach was lovely with large sort of beanbag cushions and little tables strewn around for relaxing on and there\\'s lots of activities on it including dance classes, aerobics and the slightly insane kids foam party. The kids loved the little &quot;farm&quot; and the pony trekking was a great hit. The older kids also loved the forest canopy walk and low wire. The bouncy castle on the beach was good fun. There were 2 things I thought Centerparcs just didn\\'t get right and was a bit disappointed in:1) They really don\\'t make any effort whatsoever to cater for non-French people onsite. Non of the staff spoke anything other than French, the translations of activities and events into English was really badly done, safety instructions for the boat hire and pony trekking were only delivered in French and the kids disco featured not a word of any other language. I\\'ve happily spent lots of time in other campsites, parks and hotels in France and I make the effort to speak French as much as I can but normally parks also make an effort to make it easier for visitors from abroad, generally with staff speaking more than one language (e.g. kids ents staff saying Bonjour, Hello, Hallo) . Lac d\\'Ailette doesn\\'t do this AT ALL so you\\'d probably need to brush up on your French before going. 2) The waterfront area is really beautifully done, the frontage of all the shops and restaurants lovely but absolutely empty because they are far far too expensive, particularly in the current climate. \\u20ac5 for a large beer, \\u20ac3.90 for a kids icecream, \\u20ac4 for a smoothie, it just all seemed extortionate. Can\\'t understand why they don\\'t lower the prices and the places would be packed. We ordered takeaway pizzas and these seemed better value. Centerparcs overall are great for families, we felt the price of our stay (at \\u20ac1,000 for the 4 person premium villas) offered great value for money  and there\\'s tonnes of stuff for everyone of all ages to enjoy.

We had a prestige 2 bed villa which was lovely, v clean and with good facilities - although no oven which is something to bear in mind when taking food or buying it either on site or at the hypermarket. The weather was great and there is plenty to do with a fantastic water world with loads of slides and a wave machine and a nice soft play area (both of which are free). Aside from that there\\'s a good beach and other bits and pieces for the kids to do. Some of the opening times were a tad odd but i guess we were off season being the first week of Sept for example the beach bar was only open on Sat and Sun. We ate out on the first night at the Italian and it was fairly poor (dodgy service and way too much salt and after a really small complaint / comment they gave us the entire meal and drinks for free which was unnecessary but a nice touch all the same.) The rest of the time we cooked our own meals having bought  food from either the shop on site which is pricey but not overly so, or the hypermarket near Laon. We ventured out to the surrounding villages which are OK and the first world war cemeteries which are obviously worth visiting. There are also quite a few walks / cycle tracks from the camp to the surrounding areas which are really nice and easy to navigate. All in all no real complaints, staff v pleasant, could probably have done with some more entertainment in the evening if that\\'s your thing, and a laundrette (the closest is in Loan but the jacuzzi bath and some persil doesn\\'t do a bad job!) the other point to note is that the golf buggies and cars can be a bit of a hazard / annoyance and  but none of this distracts from a great place to spend a week - especially with young kids and at a cheaper rate than CenterParcs in the UK.", "title": "Great place to spend a week with the kids", "rating": "5", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 11, 2010", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " September 2010"},

The first time we went was shortly after it opened and although we had a great time our villa was not as clean as it should have been so this time we went for a VIP villa in the hope it would be better - sadly not!! On arrival the last occupants food was still in the fridge, the toilets hadn\\'t been flushed let alone cleaned, the sheets were dirty and the dishwasher was still running! There was someones else hairs and hair band in the bath and their wet bath mat, oh and if I am going to be really picky dust all over the tv! I didn\\'t dare examine under the beds or look closely at the floor! After taking some pictures to help us explain we went to reception to complain and the lady was very charming, very apologetic and to be fair they came out and changed the sheets, cleaned the bathrooms and disposed of the leftover food, they also arranged for a fresh bread delivery every day which was very nice, as an apology. Although the villa was still not as clean as it could be for the sake of our family holiday we put it behind us and we did have a great time.  The setting is fabulous, the staff were friendly although yes a bit thin on the ground and we were able to book our activities when we wanted.  The pool was busy but we discovered that the best time to go was over lunchtime and we aways got lockers, showers were cold though! Usually managed to grab a couple of sun loungers too. Bikes were ok, my bike was the only one with a working light, but if we could have been bothered we could have gone back and swapped for ones that did work. Ate out at the Italian restaurant on first night, have to say that it wasn\\'t great, got our drinks order wrong, food could have been better and very overpriced, service was terrible, so we just cooked after that, found a supermarket about 20 mins away and stocked up there, parc shop ok but expensive, but I think they always are! You may be surprised to hear we would go back, our boys just love it, I am always disappointed by the cleanliness of Center Parcs accomodation generally but the positives tend to outweigh the negatives, we have been to both english and french center parcs and I have to say that the french ones are not so rigid on the rules as the english ones and this works both ways, yes cars do seem to appear when they shouldn\\'t but if you are out for 10 minutes more on your pedalo than you should be nobody seems very bothered, I think its just the french way!!", "title": "Standards not as good as they should be!", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "November 17, 2010", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " October 2010"},

I am not the sort of person to complain, but I am an avid user of Trip Advisor and feel I have to write an honest review based on our experience at Center Parcs Le Lac d\\'Ailette.  We travelled with our four children aged between 1 and 14 years old and paid over \\u00a32500 for a weeks stay during October half term including bike hire and towel hire in a premium cottage.On arrival, check-in was very speedy with our e-ticket. As we arrived before 3pm, we went to hire some bikes after leaving our car in the car park.  There was a choice of bikes and we were left to go and choose our own bikes.  There were quite a few bikes without chain guards, with flat tyres and with broken lights &amp; I had to have a bike with no chain guard and no working light ,but we remained positive and cycled to find our cottage.  Upon arriving at our cottage, I am sorry to say that it was one disappointment after another.  Cottage should have been a 4 bedroom premium lakeside &amp; an end cottage (we paid extra for this). The lake view was completely hidden by trees &amp; bushes and we weren\\'t actually on the edge of the lake, but again we looked at this in a positive light and admired the view of the lake which was lovely from one of the bedrooms upstairs. We weren\\'t really what I would class as an end cottage as next door was very close, but not the end of the world.I hate having to write this but the cottage really was not clean at all.  It smelt of a combination of damp and dust &amp; we soon all started coughing.  We opened windows and cleaned as best as we could which wasn\\'t the best start to our holiday. Carpets were so dirty with so many stains on them that it was hard to tell what colour they were when new.  They were disgusting. As time passed we discovered a huge clump of hair in the shower (not ours), dirty and very torn bedding, our socks quickly became black from the dirty floors, kitchen and kitchen utensils were dirty &amp; we kept finding hairs around the cottage which weren\\'t ours. Our one year old then discovered a plug socket completely hanging out from the wall which was very dangerous.  She then was eating sweets on the sofa which weren\\'t ours. Her cot was broken.  Sofa and chairs filthy &amp; very stained. We had a lovely imprint of a shoe on the lounge wall with a squashed bug where someone had obviously swatted a bug with their shoe.  One of our heaters in the lounge didn\\'t work.  Towels which had cost 7 Euros to hire were so small and thin it was unbelievable. We hung our coats up in the hallway and the coat hook fell off the wall. We discovered one of the dining chairs was completely broken so moved that to the side so no-one sat on it by mistake. The cottage itself looked new from the outside, but looked in need of a full refurbishment inside.  I don\\'t know if we have just been very unlucky but our cottage really was filthy and I\\u2019m not exaggerating. Anyway for our first evening we went to the Italian restaurant.  We were given a highchair for our one year old.   We put her in the highchair and when the waiter came to take our order he lent on the highchair and the highchair completely broke sending our baby tumbling through a hole in the highchair to the floor backwards.  The waiter tried to catch the falling wooden highchair which then fell on top of our baby who was laying screaming on the tiled floor.  It was awful and made me feel sick. I thought she would need a trip to hospital, but thankfully she was ok. The waiter apologised and we didn\\'t blame him or Center Parcs.   I smiled, calmed my baby and still continued to remain positive about the rest of our holiday.  I ate my pizza with my baby on my lap as she wouldn\\'t sit back in another highchair. The next day we went swimming.  It was packed!!  It was very difficult to find an empty changing room with people pushing and shoving but I still kept smiling. After finding an empty locker we put all our clothes in there, inserted our Euro and tried to lock it.  The locker didn\\'t lock and our Euro was lost.  To cut a long story short many lockers didn\\'t work.  We then couldn\\'t find anywhere to sit in the swimming area so had to just leave our towels on the side.  It took half an hour to queue to get a drink in the pool area.  Only one member of staff was working. Changing room floors had many hairs on them.The sports hall, despite stating that it had trampolines, inflatables etc was completely empty when we went there. It looked like an empty aircraft hanger. No-one used it.We tried Mr Crocks fast food restaurant for lunch.  After waiting around 30 minutes to get served, again one member of staff serving, we finally received our order which was totally incorrect.  We took it back, waited and it was again incorrect so we returned it again.  I now had a screaming baby and toddler and didn\\'t feel like I was on holiday.  We finally ended up with 6 burgers and one portion of chips between five of us.  We all wanted a burger and chips each so it wasn\\'t a difficult order.  We gave up, ate what we could stomach and left. In the evening we went to the bowling bar.  Again only one member of staff trying to serve everyone &amp; clear tables resulting in very slow service.  This same member of staff was also trying to fix the bowling lanes which kept going wrong.  We played a game of bowling &amp; yes our lane too kept going wrong.  Looking back it was quite funny as none of us could find bowling shoes to fit so we all looked like clowns wearing these huge bowling shoes that didn\\'t fit us. On a more serious note our one year old was crawling on the floor amongst small pieces of broken glass.  Luckily we noticed before she started picking the glass up and putting it in her mouth.The Baluba children\\u2019s play area upstairs was large and good, although floor wasn\\u2019t cleaned.  Our younger children loved it in there.  I tried to ignore the trail of blood which led to the toilets where someone had obviously cut themselves and walked to the toilets, however when the trail of blood was still there the next day, I felt the lack of cleanliness was unacceptable.  There was also a spilt drink on the floor which was there for at least two days.  I also noticed a toilet cleaner sign the wall chart to say she had checked and cleaned the toilets, when she hadn\\u2019t even gone into the toilets to check them.For the rest of our holiday we cooked in the cottage.  We did try to get into the pancake restaurant one lunchtime, but were turned away after queuing for some time, as it was full.  There isn\\'t an oven, just microwave and hob.  On site shop is very expensive and not well stocked.  We bought a pack of cards, watched DVD\\'s which we had brought with us on our DVD player which we also brought with us from home and enjoyed quality family time together.  We laughed and had fun.We bought some eclairs in the on-site bakery, but my teenage daughter found a mass of hairs in the icing and none of us wanted to eat ours after that. I dread to think how much spending money we got through during our weeks stay.Also unlike the UK Center Parcs, (we have been to them 3 times) cars are not taken back to the car parks by many people and cars, vans and golf buggies are often driving around the roads.  My older children felt unsafe as some people drove far too fast and expected the cyclists to just get out of the way. It was dangerous.To sum up I know this review may sound unbelievable and I also realise that I must sound like a very hard to please, complaining type of person, but all I can do is promise you that this is the first time that I have felt strongly enough about something to complain and everything I have written is accurate and nothing is exaggerated.  And yes we have laughed, yes we have remained positive throughout, but if I won a holiday to return I wouldn\\'t come.  I am very glad to be home.To sum up, in our opinion, the major issue here is lack of staff.  All staff try their best but they can only do so much.  I truly believe with more staff this Center Parcs could be lovely.  The setting and lake are beautiful.Hope this helps. I wish I could have written a more positive review, but I have to provide my honest opinion. Maybe we were just unlucky\\u2026.Sharon", "title": "Not for us...dirty and understaffed", "rating": "2", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "October 30, 2010", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " October 2010"},

The lake location is great and having a cottage right on the lake side was excellent. The cottage itself was a 2 bed house which in our opinion was better than the traditional Center Parcs chalet/bungalow. The furniture was the usual Center Parcs quality but was clean and adequate (though the cheap foam mattresses on the beds weren\\'t very comfy). We never cooked there, staying only for the weekend, but would imagine only having a hob and microwave would be very limiting.The parc itself felt new and was well maintained and clean. The brightly coloured houses were a welcome difference and although less woody than other parcs it was very pleasant. The Aqua Mundo was loved by all, the kids especially, and never felt too busy, queues for slides rarely being more than 10 people long. The Baluba indoor play area was huge and a particular hit with our 2 children who took every possible opportunity to go there and play. Again this was never very busy though the sunshine outside may have been the reason why,  it could have been quite different on rainy days.As with every Center Parcs additional activities to those above were expensive and we limited ourselves to minigolf, bowling and boat hire which in total came to over \\u00a360 for the 4 of us - not too bad for a weekend. I could imagine however older children would want to do more and this in my opinion is where Center Parcs isn\\'t great as it becomes so expensive, with nothing but the pool and play areas being free.The restaurants were OK, not cheap but not overly expensive and the food was of good quality. The childrens menus were limited however and would become tiresome very quickly. Service was good everywhere and you can get by only speaking English but you will find life easier if you can manage even a little French.In short, as the title says, it is still Center Parcs but newer and cleaner than our experiences in the UK. For us, living in Kent, a short train/ferry trip and a 2hr drive from Calais was simpler than the trek to Wiltshire / Suffolk / Nottinghamshire. We also combined this with a stay on a farm near Amiens booked through Un Lit au Pre (Featherdown Farms in the UK) which was fantastic and highly recommended for a bit of glamping (glamorous camping).", "title": "Just like the UK but better", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 17, 2010", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2010"},

Positives - Hired a 6 bed comfort villa for 4 which gave plenty of space although would be tight for 6 people. Limited storage for clothes especially if there were 6 of you.Facilities - good choice of activities for all ages, with segway and off road buggying (expect to get very dirty!) top of the choices.Surrounding area - Surrounding countryside is very scenic with plenty of historical sites in local area. Laon provides attractive walled city plus good sized supermarket offering more choice and much cheaper prices than camp supermarket.Staff - from previous postings we expected that we would be struggling with our limited French, however we found that most of the staff would try to use their limited English or at least try to provide a service by using mix of French &amp; English. Service was generally good especially from the staff running the activities.Aquamundo - good size with variety of slides, rapids and pools.Restaurants - range of choices with food being good quality, buffet provided good quality food and all you can drink option. Negatives -Kitchen - tiny and provides very basic facilities for self catering with no oven. Microwave and hob provided with some utensils.Laundrette - none on site with nearest being in Laon.Games - For teenagers the choice is a little limited with a small selection of computer games, pool tables and table football, during the day not too much of an a issue but during the evening it was difficult to get on the tables. In summary the park looks attractive, is in a lovely setting and for those that like to explore has some interesting towns and sites within easy travelling. The site is set against a valley wall so the hills can be steep especially if your villa is away from the lake.

The swimming complex is possibly the best of any of the Centre Parcs and we all spent many happy hours on the many slides and river rapids. Our villa had a DVD player which was great as all TV channels are in French apart from CNN. the kitchen is a little cramped and there is no oven, however thanks to other reports on trip adviser, we took our own wok and whipped up a quick spagetti bolognaise and chilli on a couple of days when we wanted to chill out rather than eat out.

Finally and a real issue for us ... we usually book 2 weeks in the same location as we\\'re travelling so far ... but there\\'s no change of linen/towels after a week ... this is really poor and the same in every Centreparcs in France.As with all Centre Parcs, if you buy from the supermarket on site, you\\'re mad. Twice the price of the excellent LeClerc and Carrefour on the outskirts in Laon.This is the Champagne region and a trip to Reims should be celebrated with a few bottles. Laon is a very nice town with a range of good and reasonable restaurants. We walked it many times and really enjoyed it. Obviously this is in the North-East and so the weather can be overcast and warm rather than sunny and hot! Just be conscious of this.Paul Quinn, Dublin, Ireland", "title": "Best Centre Parc in France", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "September 4, 2009", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2009"},

This worked well on the back of a couple of days at Disneyland Paris, and had a one week stay from Friday 24th to Fri 31st July 2009.On the whole, we did enjoy our stay, and probably would return. Highlights for us include the lake vista and the swimming complex (aqua monda), Lowlights include the value/choice at the restaurants and parc market, and a general feeling that the site is understaffed for the price we had paid.OVERALL SITE - Position in France is good from weather perspective, we seemed to avoid most of the weather fronts which swept rain into England - just the occasional shower, and temperature around 24 degrees in the afternoons -  very pleasant, and one had to watch for sunburn especially in the midst of the day. Checkin worked well, and we found our villa promptly, was well prepared and ready to use. Someone arrived at the villa to check all ok - and fixed a cooker extractor cover for us quickly, and provided towels. Perhaps to be expected, but few English speaking guests or staff.  Main centre is very attractive  by the lakeside. Disappointingly, We found several of the public toilets to be smelly, dirty and several taps not working - empty soap dispensors - clearly not checked, cleaned and maintained as they should be The main toilet facilities which are in the top level of the centre appeared very &quot;tired&quot; - cracked walls, stained patches - did not appear very welcoming - this needs to be improved.VICINITY - We did enjoy a day trip to Laon, and also a bike ride to the Abbey at Vauclaire- both we would recommend to others, especially those who plan to be on site for a week. Info desk helped us in planning these trips, providing maps leaflets etc.VILLA LOCATION - We chose a lakeside 3bed villa. Marvelous lakeside view from patio, was a holiday highlight, with setting sun over opposite hills. Plenty of ducks etc to provide entertainment. Distance to main centre, at 15mins walk, was a little long (need bikes), but we were glad we were not &quot;overlooked&quot;, or &quot;up the hill&quot; as others were. We would choose same villa again, but others may see this as too far from the centre.VILLA FACILITIES - Our villa was inside clean, lots of cobwebs on the lakeside patio which we brushed away, and all beds made up. We were please with the size, and layout of the villa - were 4 of us in a 3 bed cottage (kids each had own room). TV has choice of french channels (would have been nice to see one UK channel, even if only BBC world!). Kitchen area a little cramped, with microwave and dishwasher, but no oven! - no BBQ either. Villa would have seemed small if we had been party of six. RESTAURANTSWe enjoyed the Italian (visited twice) and Creperie - but found otherwise a very limited choice or value for money. Several offer a &quot;Buffet choice&quot; - actually the SAME dessert buffet choice for several  different restaurants. Would have been nice to see ability to order food in bowling bar area (e.g. as in Longleat or Elveden). Food generally expensive, even allowing for sterling/euro rate.  Service was mixed,  we got the impression the restaurants were understaffed - in one case we had to go to find the waiter, when one dessert had not appeared 20mins after the others. Service is automatically included in pricing, which does not give any discretion on how service (or lack of it) should be rewarded (or Not!) BIKES - compared to other UK Bike Parc sites, the facility appeared very much a &quot;help yourself&quot; approach, and it took me several attempts to find a bike which did not have something broken - and then I had to settle for one with a malfunctioning light. There appeared little manpower to assist in choosing bikes. Bikes do not have a chain guard, so after snagging some trousers, I was wearing shorts the rest of the week. I did like the integral bike locks - UK could adopt this approach, although this does tend to mean that Bikes are simply abandoned wherever people feel they can leave them - adherence to bike parks was not enforced, with often bikes left in the road.INTERNET - Free Wireless available in Bowling/Bar area, also wired to some villas (we did get this). For a weekly fee, we had cabled internet to the villa, but for some incomprehensible reason, the password is reset every day, so until each day you can get to the information desk (opens at 9am), to get a new daily password, there is no access to the internet. This became a daily nuisance having to queue up at the desk, just to be given a new password. Staff always very helpful when you got to the front of the queue, but what a waste of time, having paid up-front for a weeks access.BAKERY / PARC MARKET - Parc Market is relatively small, with limited and expensive choices. It also closes every lunchtime, so just when you want to go and buy something for lunch (eg pre-prepared sandwiches), it is closed. Bakery was good, very good selection of patisseries and breads, and opened at 07:30. Parc Market only opens at 09:00am. Limited space for packing bags once through the tills. Often queues at tills. Local supermarkets (if you have the energy to venture off-site) are vastly superior in choice and value.SPORTS HALL - Those expecting a &quot;Jardin de Sports&quot; will be disappointed - this is just a large box shaped warehouse, with courts arranged within - no frills, and very confusing markings. For example if you wanted to play badminton, one had to ignore red and white lines and concentrate on the black lines. Seemed empty most of the time. Somehow seems an underdeveloped facility. Again a &quot;Help yourself&quot; approach to this facility. Outdoor tennis was fine.LAKE FACILITIES - We enjoyed the electric boats, bit pricy, but good fun. We could not understand why certain days peddalows were &quot;not available&quot; - eg on Fridays - seems an unnecessary constraint. They were there, the attendant was present, so why can we not book these ?  Again times at lunchtime when facilities shut down ? Gave the impression of limited staff availability. AQUA MUNDA - This was one of the highlights of the site, good slides, good pools, interesting arrangement  of water flow from inside /outside. The &quot;River Savage&quot; was a little tame for those used to the UK wild water rapids, but otherwise all good fun. On some days, various slides appeared closed for no apparent reason - perhaps staff shortages again ? Also, given long summer evenings, closing pool around 8:30pm did seem a little early ? - why not keep open longer ? UK sites are open beyond this. Teenagers want to go at this time, so why deny this ?BEACH AREA - Very popular, and the children enjoyed a session on the &quot;Segway&quot; Mini-Golf also popular and enjoyable, although expensive. Some holes require a &quot;try many times&quot; approach, which leads to bunching and queueing around the course. Beach has hammocks, and the ability to swim in a limited area of the lake.BOWLING / BAR - Bowling alley broke on us, so 20mins of our 60 (for 25 Euro) were wasted in changing lanes - rekeying initials into another screen. Delay in getting Drinks. Some of the pool tables &quot;out of order&quot;. So top 5 highlights would be- Position of site with weather, local attractions and accessibility from Disneyland / UK.- Lakeside Villa, views over water and general Vista- Aqua Munda - great pools, slides, and general water fun- Lake Boating - we did like the electric boats.- Bakery - great selection of breads and pastriesSo top 5 gripes would be:-- Better Restaurant Choice and value for money, better service - Better Parc Market - opening hours, choice and value.- Cleaner and better maintained central toilet facilities.- More opening times for lake facilities, and aqua munda / slides.- Villa - better TV channels, and no need to reset internet passwords every dayAll in all we enjoyed - nice to see feedback taken on board though", "title": "Great Lake Vista - Retaurants Disappointing", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 2, 2009", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2009"},

With a young family, my main requirement is plenty of things for them to do and this Center Parcs more than met that need.The Aqua Mundo was fantastic and the children spent many, many hours there.  Alongside the flumes, wave pool and rapids you find at all Center Parcs villages there was also a large water play house with more slides, high pressure water jets and, of course, the huge bucket that fills an empties itself over everyone every few minutes.There was also the Baluba - a large indoor soft play area - as well as an extensive outdoor play area too.The accomodation was a little different to that normally found at Center Parcs with most of the villa\\'s being two storey houses.  Our villa was a three bedroom Comfort Plus and we found it to be clean, spacious and an ideal base for our 1 week stay.The only area where I have to report disappointment was with the food.  The restaurants were only open at set times, a few hours around lunch and dinner times.  If you weren\\'t there at opening time, you could expect to stand in a queue for at least half an hour before sitting.  If you wanted to eat outside of the limited restaurant opening hours, your only choice was the &quot;Mister Croc&quot; fast food restaurant, which was anything but fast.  On one day, it was 45 minutes between the time when we joined the queue and the moment when our food arrived.  And there were only 3 people in the queue!However, I will add that we had New Years Eve dinner at the Embarcadere restaurant and that was absolutely fantastic.Overall, I would more than recommend Lac D\\'Ailette to anyone with familes and young children as the large play areas are more than adequate to keep them entertained all day long.

We were attracted to this parc as it is the newest of the group and a show piece site. The prices were great for half term as it is not a french holiday ususally the price bracket makes this parc seem too expensive compared to the dutch and belgium sites.On the plus side the aqua mundo is the biggest and best we have seen. Loads of slides and rapids (though not as fierce as De Vossermerman!) There is a also a superb waterplayhouse which kept our 2 amused for ages. The changing rooms were very clean and everything was very smart.The children\\'s playarea was also huge with outdoor slides and a range of activities. The advantage of an indoor Baluba was a bonus point too. The French were very quick with check in and although we couldn\\'t access our villa until 3 we did have keyys early so no pointless queuing twice.On the negative side this site is very hilly - looks attractive but it was an uphill struggle with our 2 on bikes literally. ( Guess I have been spoilt by flat dutch sites) We went as a 2 family party  8 in total and hired a premium 4 room villa - compared to the old style villas in Holland and Belgium it was very small. The bedrooms were ok but the kitchen and living area were a joke for 8 people - had a quick look at the smaller houses and the living space seemed similar to ours! We were in a mid terrace 218 if you do go with 2 families make sure you request an end cottage as the patio space was much larger and you seemed to have more space216 /215 looked better but check on map before you book!Make sure you take all your food or at least stop at a local supermarket in Laon we did take most of our stuff but ran short of milk etc the prices in the shop on site were a joke and highly inflated \\u00a33.00 for a bottle of tonic water anyone? Also everything including the shop were shut at various points in the day so make sure you note the times.One last moan we had a bad storm on the first night - not cp fault but on Tuesday all the slides and shutes apart from 1 in aqua mundo were shut - we initially put this down to debris but later on the inside single slide shut too! Off we went for lunch and returned later surely the slides and rapids would be working now! Off course they were not 2 separate lifeguards told us it was always like this on Tuesday and it was due to a lack of staff! Many people were outraged at this after all the aqua mundo is cp and when you are on a 4 day break 1 day out really counts. The official line was it was due to the storms - however this didn\\'t explain why the inside slides that had been working earlier were now not - happily it was all fine by Wed.Overall we felt that although the site was beautiful and the facilities good it was spoilt by  overpricing things that were free in the other cps had to be paid for like childrens wannabe activities and resturants / shops were pricier.Would we return? probably not I would rather spend my hard earned euros at the belgium / Dutch sites!", "title": "ok but a bit of a rip off!", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "May 30, 2009", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2009"},

The park is particularly attractive, and the sun shone every day. We loved the multicoloured villa, our wasnt on the edge of the lake but did have lake views. We were pleased with the accomodation, the comfort villa for 6, suited our family of five. (although it would have been small for 6 adults). The decor was cheery - the main bedroom was decorated in shocking pink- and as we had an end villa, we had decking on both the back and the side of our villa which meant that we could catch the sun at any time of the day. The only downside was no oven and no bbq, so had to be quite creative with my cookingWe have three boys aged 9, 7 and 7. They loved the swimming complex, which was packed at the weekend, but quiet during the week, especially on the change over days. There were numerous slides and flumes and virtually no queuing. The whole swimming complex was clean and welcoming. I had read the restaurant reviews so didn\\'t eat out on site. Also the shop on site was very expensive, The supermarket in the local town -Laon was half the price. Our boys did scootering and roller blading, we went on the beach, in the outdoor playgrounds, played beach volleyball  and used the football pitch to play cricket- all free. We didnt go in the indoor sports hall or play areas as the weather was so nice, we wanted to be outside. (although you couldn\\'t swim in the lake)We had a partcularly nice day out in Laon, there was av intage car rally on which was interesting, lots of old Britsh cars and then a race around the streets, theere seems to be a lot goign on in Laon, probably worth doing some research before you go. We also visited Eurodisney - 1hour 40 mins drive from the site.Also, we didnt meet any other English families, we liked this, but other visitors might find this an issue.

If you drive from UK ( London). It is significantly closer to the Channel ports than the Dutch parks I have visited ( Zelande &amp; Kempervennen ). Also the motorways are quicker and less busy.  I got a good value eurotunnel crossing (\\u00a365) for a midweek half term stay. The aqua mundo is very impressive. Loads of rides, short queues. My 5 year old daughter and her cousins went barmy for them. Lots of different grades of height and speed for the more timid children. The park is very clean and looks new, facilities are very good. The smaller children loved the baluba.Tips: The supermarket is expensive and has variable opening times which are much shorter than Dutch centre parcs. If I went again I would take more food with us. The car park is a fair distance from our house (448) so going out to a supermarket would have been a long round trip.Restaurants are quite expensive , mainly due to euro conversion rate. Again, taking food from the Uk or stopping at a French Supermarket would be good idea.We went on one trip off-site, to Coucy-le-Chateau-Affrique.Historic walled town with dramatic views across the Sant Gobain forest.

(Euro to \\u00a3 was nearly like for like).The journey from Eurotunnel was just over 2 hours - an easy run on the motorways.We had already checked in on line and printed off the voucher; on arrival at the entrance gates we just handed in our voucher, we were given our tickets in return and just drove in.  That was by far the quickest check in of any CP.The area is very pretty and we found our villa ok - we booked a two bedroom premium which was close to the main lake, with an upstairs and downstairs.  Everything was clean enough although it smelt very fusty.  Beds were made, dishwasher tablets &amp; a dishcloth were provided.  The car park is back in the centre and up a large hill.  You pass the bike hire on the way back and it took about an hour to get sorted - the child seats that sit on the back of the bike were free (unlike Dutch CP) and so were the locks for bikes that didn\\'t have them built in.  We thought we would hire a helmet for our 4 year old but you have to buy them (\\u00a311).The park in general is easy to cycle around; the beach is great, there are plenty of play areas for children/teens, a skate park, pony rides (about \\u00a310 for half an hour walking round the park) but no \\'farm\\' that others have.  The Aqua park is great.  There are slides for everyone, plenty of rapids where we all had hours of fun, wave machine, and a toddler area.  Seating was slightly limited.  There is a cafe in there which was good.Now for the bad bit - the food.  We pre-paid for 3 nights dinner in the Marche du Monde based on previous experiences in Holland where we have had plenty of choice and value for money.  However here it was poor; limited choice: the salad bar was terrible and unappetising, the \\'stews\\' of beef or lamb really looked like the previous day\\'s leftovers, although some were better than others.  There was a chef cooking steaks and burgers to order which was probably the freshest although on our last night it was very busy (the first time we had to queue to get in) and they did have a gammon and roasted pork on offer.  The choice really did not change every night.  The cheese were ok, but by 8.30pm you were left with scraps.  Deserts were ok, but all the same: apple tart, yogs, coconut tart and lots of different blommonges.  There were icecreams for the kids which were good.  For babies there were always baby foods freely available.The bakery was excellent - it opened 7.30am and warm bread/croissants were ready.  The supermarket did not open until 9am and they had a terrible problem with fresh milk.  Unless you got there for 9am you had no chance of getting a fresh pint.  And they only had about 50 bottles delivered for the whole park!  Some days it was semi, others full, there was no guessing what you would get.  But there were plenty of food choices in the supermarket although prices were pretty high as per norm.We did eat one night in the Italian which was good and decent service.  Pizzas started at \\u00a310 each so a family of 4 would probably average \\u00a345 (we only had a couple of beers).  All children under 4 ate free at all times which was good.We did visit Crocs cafe in the dome area once - service was terrible!  The information folk were very helpful and were there most times until late.  We booked our 4 year old in to the Wannabe kids club once (pre-paid \\u00a37) to be a fireman and it was excellent.  It was for 2 hours although you joined them near the end to watch them with the hoses and take photos.  The Balluba indoor play area was very good.We had a huge electrical storm on our first night and some kind of freak wind storm which brought down a lot of trees and took off roof tiles and other damage.  It was quite amazing/scary and there was a lot of damage in the park and the tree climbing activity was closed &amp; would be for the next few weeks.  But staff were out very early the next morning checking damage and made sure everyone was ok.  We were lucky but some villas had trees on them!Overall it was a good few days off (Mon to Fri).  Food really let it down and if you do not speak any French then be warned - only a limited number of staff will attempt English but we managed with basic French.  I\\'m not sure we would visit again and would try Vosserman in Belgium or back to Holland but it was an enjoyable break.We did go up to Laon one morning and I would recommend the Cathedral which is amazing.  The shops/cafes are spread out and choices were limited.  Parking was easy to access at the top of the medievil town (free) and there is an information centre next to the cathedral.On the way home we went off to Vimy Ridge, the Canadian WW1 memorial and I would really recommend a visit.  Canadian students run it and there is something for all ages.  The memorial itself is HUGE and then two minutes down the road is the visitors centre and trenches for you to walk in.  There are also underground tunnels to go down with a guide.  You can see the craters and old trenches which can\\'t be accessed because of the unexploded bombs.  This is just off the motorway home, head towards Vimy/Arras and it is sign posted.  Picnic area and toilets also there - its about 50 minutes onwards to Calais (and a quick shop at Sainsburys, Coquelles for great wine bargains).", "title": "A different type of Centerparcs", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "May 31, 2009", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2009"},

Also take insect repellent we got eaten alive with the forest and lake insects.My teenagers went clubbing a couple of nights and stayed out late drinking with no hassels (apart from one of them coming off their bike drunk) but hey they really enjoyed themselves.Would like to think we will be back here again nxt year.But will go for a luxury villa - only \\u00a3120 more than a comfort villa well worth it.Channing family - Devon", "title": "fab fab fab", "rating": "5", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "June 2, 2008", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2008"},

The parc is situated on the Northern side of a lake. The terrain is undulating and easy to cycle, except from reception and the carpark from which there is a short steep down hill. The best about the parc is the Aqua Mundo which is the best that any center parcs has to offer, with 5 flumes of which two are dark, plus 4 slides. There is the savage river (although more gentle than at other parcs) and a very long lazy river plus slides at the pre-teen Water Mill. There is a very good large sandy beach from which limited swimming is permitted. There are few water sports with no sailing or wind-surfing.Most of the villas are two storey, this means they are closer together than at other parcs and with less trees about not very private. You can see onto many of your neighbours balconies/decking and also the same of many you go past. The water side villas are best with those at the end having more balcony space. Try to avoid inland villas in the 700 to 900 range they appear to lose then sun quite early and are poorly situated. We had a 3 bed premier villa for four of use, I tihnk six would have found it quite cramped, there is far less storage space for clothes than in villas at other parcs. One room has no wardrobe. The kitchen is pratical but limited, there is a very large fridge, cooking is restricted like all European Center Parcs to microwave and hob, so you have too be a bit inventive as to what you can cook. Also the inventory isn\\'t balanced to british tastes. The sporting facilites are poor compared to other parcs, and remember parcs in europe are less well served than those in the UK anyway. The sports hall is just a large sweaty hanger. The main restaurant shops area is impersonal and lacks any ambience and is not as nice as other parcs. Also there is less choice, in particular we missed a sports bar where you can get a late night snack, its either a sit down meal or nothing.

It\\'s the 6th Center Parcs site we\\'ve visited and is very different.It\\'s a more quality environment and is not in the semi-camping tradition of CentreParcs.  I\\'m not sure about the environmental credentials either. It appears to be a bit of an eyesore - a transplanted seaside resort in the middle of the countryside. Its more like Disney\\'s Newport Beach Hotel than the average CentreParcs resort. Maybe the owners, Pierre et Vacances, have influenced the design - its very much like some of their beach resorts. The positives are that the cottages are very comfortable and facilities are generally good. Cycles were well maintained and I easily found one to suit me  - unlike Holland, where sizing accommodates the freakishly tall Dutch! The traffic free principle was well-maintained and the beach area and restaurants along the lake were very pleasant.Overall the Aquamundo is probably the best I\\'ve been too although there are better rapids and slides elsewhere. There were a lot of negatives though.  The cottages are not as isolated and you are more likely to be overlooked than usual. There were no logs for sale for cottage fires. I appreciate this is environmentally good but it felt less cozy in the evenings. There is only one English language channel (CNN). That\\'s probably no longer good enough at the price. Cyclng out of the site is not easy (although, admittedly, Holland is a very different place). In view of the huge investment Centre Parcs coudl have funded some local road improvements to make it easier to cycle safely to nearby sites such as the ruined Cistertian Abbey about 5 miles away.The sports hall is basic but OK and at least equipment was new. Using your own could save some money but my son was particularly disappointed at the lack of a football tournament.Shops and restaurants were shut too much. They opened late, shut at lunchtime and closed early. Its supposed to be a holiday park. The facilities should be open whenever the customers need them. Local culture is just going to have to change to accommodate this fact of life.Restaurants were expensive and offered poor value for money. We were happy with snack service from the bowling alley but service in the Pancake House was laughable. We waited 30 mins for a simple crepe. They compensated for the wait by offering free drinks and then overcharged me on the bill! We gave them a second chance later in the week but after waiting 10 mins for any attention from staff we walked out.The market buffet restaurant was also poor value. 20 Euros each. No ambience and very mediocre buffet food. What\\'s all this about French cuisine being the best in the world? It certainly wasn\\'t here.Despite everything, it\\'s a high quality site with great cottages and the facilities for a relaxing few days.

We are avid Center Parcs Sherwood users and took the plunge to stray simply due to the huge price difference...was much cheaper for the accomodation in France during the half term. Having said that, we did find the prices of meals out and some activities to be rather steep, the Euro not assisting in this of course. For example it costs us approximately 70 euros plus for a buffet evening meal and a large Stella was just shy of 5 Euros a time - however we were on our hols and would not let this put us off returning.The pool was fantastic - many many slides to enjoy as a family and the different childrens area were excellent and very enjoyable. The resort was fully booked and yet we never had to queue for too long and never had trouble finding a lounger round the pool. It was a saving grace due to the weather being none too pretty most of the time.The staff were very accomodating. We did not have many problems communicating despite our embarassingly limited French....we found that so long as we were polte, they were helpful were possible. The only downside, langage-wise, was that none of the information leaflets or welcome brochures/activity brochures were in English and we found it a bit difficult to know what to do/where to go.Service was fast, friendly and efficient everywhere we went which was a real bonus.Accomodation was clean, very well equipped (we had a 2 bed comfort villa) and very inviting. The setting and colour of the well kept buildings really cheered us up as we biked round on the rainy days.The childrens play and adventure areas where of a very high standard, very safe and clean and varied.Our 2 little ones decided to go to 2 kids clubs. We were concerned they may be uncomfy should the language barrier be a problem but staff at the information centre advised us which ones would be best for them. They attended a Circus one and a Models one. I have to say it was the most enjoyable kids club they have ever been too. The interaction was fantastic and on each occassion they performed a show for the parents, showing is what they had learned...very worthwhile and lots of fun for them and for us.The mini disco was not just a dj playing kids music, it was fully interactive with the entertainment team and again we could not knock them at all...our children were thrilled and relaxed kids means relaxed parents!There was not the selection of activities to choose from like we were used to at Sherwood and we did find that 5 days was enough for us in that respect but I imagine if we had been luckier with the weather then we would have been able to take more advantage of the beautiful surroundings that the park is set in and laze on the beach perhaps.", "title": "Happy kids = happy parents ;)", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b0/4c/5b/center-parcs-le-lac-d.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Lac d'Ailette", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1 Parc Nautique de l'Ailette", "addressLocality": "Chamouille", "addressRegion": "Hauts-de-France", "postalCode": "02860", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "May 31, 2008", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2008"},

Whilst not huge fans of center parcs, we were tempted by the new accommodation and facilities.  lIt\\'s quicker to get to that the Center Parcs in Normandy so seemed ideal for a quick break.  It looks exactly as it does on the website - very colourful and all the houses are much more obvious that at many of Center Parcs other vllages where the chalets are hidden amongst trees.  On first impressions it was a bit like a very coourful Barretts housing estate!  The trees were mostly deciduous so pretty bare in April.  In the summer it\\'s probably a different picture altogether.The good things....Nice, new accommodation....we had three (small) very functional and comfortable bedrooms, two bathrooms and decent sized living room with small but adequate kitchen.  We  chose a premier village to get a villa directly on the lake.   In the summer it would have been fabulous.Considering the number of properties - my guess is up to 900, it was incredibly quiet - and I think it was fairly full to capacity.  The pool area was great - fabulous lazy river going outside and leading to an outside pool and lots of water shutes and slides.  I can only compare to Elveden and du Bois and it was much bigger/better - the kids loved it.The atmosphere was very relaxed - mosly Belguian and french - Hardly any English. (I heard 3 other english families in 5 days!)There was no problem in booking activites - unlike in England.  We tended to book bowling at 11ish in the morning and easily got 5pm, 6pm or 7pm slots.The restaurants looked good - but with the Euro at 1.22, expensive.  We didn\\'t feel like paying \\u00a311 each for pizza!The not so good.....Most notably, the sports facilities.  A huge airport type hanger houses the badminton, indoor tennis, table tennis area.  Whilst from the outside it looks promising, never have I see such untidy, dreary and generally scruffy facilities anywhere.  I guess, our feelings were generally shared as when we looked in on these once evening at 6pm, no one was using them!  Really, there would have been no pleasure in playing anything in this hall - absolutely disgraceful, yet great potential.If you like cycling, then don\\'t expect to be able to do so on flat ground.  The village is set on a fairly undulating site, so cycling can be quite hard work in places.  Also, to get out of the village, you need to head upwards, so again, no so relaxing as some of the other villages!Would I go back?   Possibly . The accommodation really is very good, as is the pool.  However, there aren\\'t many places of note to visit (although Reims is worth a visit and is less than 1 hour away).  The area is generally typical of northern France - loads of trees and fields, small villages that appear to be uninhabited and rather grey skies.

Check in was simple, you get the key upon arrival in your car at front gate, unlike those encountered in Holland where there is a mad rush to queue to check in at reception and having to wait for long periods. CP have got their act together here. Our 3 nights accomodation cost 340 euros for  a confort villa which was nicely furnished and still looked  relatively new .

Upstairs consisted of 2 bedrrooms with bathroom equipped with shower over.

All in all, a great resort to take kids for a short break. On the negative side, the landscaping has yet to be fully established.  There is no Satellite channels as found in other Center Parcs  Holland, only CNN news channel is available in english.

It is their newest village, apparently it opened 28th September 2007.It is near Laon, the nearest major town would be Reims. It\\u2019s about 2\\u00bd hours from Calais ferry terminal. The last section, across country from Jct 13 of the A26, is deceptive and it\\u2019ll take you 30 mins to reach the park from the motorway \\u2013 the road signs are good from nr Laon.The village has a new and different look about it, all of the cottages are in a kind of New England weatherboard style; each finished in a different colour, and looking like a Dulux advert!The park is so new that it\\u2019ll take a little time for all the earthworks and the planting to bed-in and begin to flourish, but you can see that it is going to develop into something really quite special.We had a great week. We rented a \\'VIP Style\\' cottage, and that accommodation was fabulous; two bedrooms, three bathrooms, body-jet shower, Jacuzzi bath, sauna with min wet-room shower area, microwave, dishwasher, all the kitchen appliances you could wish for, modern d\\u00e9cor, daily maid service &amp; fresh towels, great outside veranda and seating, and great views across the lake.Our cottage was fabulous, and very good value. Absolutely cannot fault it. We would return purely for this accommodation!The setting around the lake and in the woods is really very nice. The centre buildings open out onto lakeside boardwalk and the restaurants will provide a fabulous lakeside setting next year when the weather warms up.The main atrium and restaurant areas are quite spectacular when you first walk in.Probably the best pool that we have come across at CP; loads of slides for the kids, and a large tree house style water play area with a huge water barrel that tips and empties every few minutes.They have a huge variety of all new bicycles to choose from \\u2013 something for all ages.

No Aqua Sana area. No squash courts. The Sports Hall is probably the most basic we have seen; an aircraft hanger with tarmac surfaced courts.No English newspapers.Only one English-speaking TV channel in the cottage (CNN \\u2013 all USA News).Bread roll delivery to the cottage was not included, as it is in NL.The lack of serving staff in the restaurants and the Reception areas. The fast food bar \\u201cCroc\\u201d really suffered from this \\u2013 it just was not actually fast food at all \\u2013 there was usually a great queue of frustrated customers \\u2013 my sons complained of tepid burgers and over-cooked chips. The pizza restaurant was similarly under-staffed; 2 hours for 2 courses; the staff were very stressed and very apologetic.The Menus were generally not that special; we tried three restaurants. The ambience was great, but you had to study the menu for something you fancied (about on a par with Beefeater / Harvester).We missed the Chez Pierre type restaurant that CP would normally have in the main dome square; the coffee was not great, and the only snack available was various ice cream desserts!!
